Like - I don't think these people are any real threat, but they come across as so absurdly dishonest and fake that it raises my hackles nonetheless.> A little too agreeable> Compliments you a little too earnestly or too frequently , despite not knowing you well enough to make those comments in the first place> Uses use a lot of 'nothing-talk' to fill the gap and pretend they're conversing with you. So you're the only one actually saying anything of note. It's like they're trying to collect information on you, without actually wanting to build any equal rapport. It's not an equivalent exchange.> Uses a lot of unnecessary disclaimers (eg: 'most people' or 'sometimes' or 'so I've been led to believe') when it's not necessary. It comes across like they're trying to always think of their exit strategy in case you don't like what they said.> Every natural gesture seems oddly choreographedHonourable mention:> People who tell you all about the evil people in their lives who hurt them, and try to pretend like they were an angel even though it's obvious from context clues that they're hiding a lot of information. This is especially bad if they're obviously trying to connect with you and be 'on your level' over something genuinely traumatic that you've experienced for yourself.In short, people who try too hard to make you like them, but are obviously thoroughly dishonest about their approach.It's likely just a self-preservation technique for people who feel anxious in social situations, but by god, it skeeves me out. It's normal to be self-conscious at times, and it's normal to adjust ourselves a little bit to blend in with a group. But when taken too far, you don't come across like a person - you come across like a fucking skinwalker lmao.I live with one at the moment, and I absolutely despite him. He particularly directed that shit towards me, to the point where my other flatmate has commented that the guy is weird towards me. Note: The cool flatmate even said \"I'm autistic and even [I] noticed that shit. He's weird\".I really want to kick the guy out of the house. I'm thinking of mentioning it to the cool flatmate, but I don't know how to go about it. It's not a crime to skeeve people out."

I always knew something was off about this girl I knew in high school, idk if I would qualify for as dark energy per se. She definitely did the  “choreographed response”  thing you mentioned. I’d often hear her having the exact same conversation with someone else that she had with me and it was almost word-for-word the same. I guess she had this desire to impress everyone and signal that she’s intelligent, when in actuality, she isn’t. This highschool was well-known for its academics, because everyone was extremely competent and she wasn’t (it was obvious she was just there because her grandparents are rich) she would make a lot of effort into trying to make herself more relatable? She would always LARP as poor and it was really irritating and she would often tell fake stories about her childhood to evoke sympathy from others.a couple of times, she faked panic attacks to get out of exams. This entailed her staring blankly at the table for 10 minutes until she could squeeze out a single tear (she didn’t want to take responsibility for being unprepared) she started going around telling everyone that she has BPD (which was an obvious lie because no ethnical psychiatrist would diagnose her with that at 16) during the final year of highschool. Currently, she’s dating this younger guy who she claims is “emotionally manipulating” her (it’s most likely the other way around)"

I have always been weirdly and unsettlingly attuned to “bad energy”, as has my mother. we both recognize it in the same things and people. in highschool i had a friend who was mentally ill and later became addicted to hard drugs. when we first spent time together I knew something was wrong with her: i looked at her and there was something dark about her image. it wasn’t her clothes or makeup or anything, but rather an energy emitting from her. at this point it wasn’t malevolent, just sad and heavy, though personality wise she seemed to perky. as she became more and more addicted to drugs, it became BLACK. darker, heavier, and malevolent. i went to her home and her room was suffocating, dark, like a black hole. i would always leave feeling sticky and gross with her energy. this was before i knew anything about what or how she was doing. since her second bout of rehab it has receded. another girl my mother and i clocked immediately as having bad energy.  it’s like an invisible aura of darkness. i have always had a hard time connecting my emotions to words so i would often ignore this innate warning, but i have always been proven right. when something has a dark energy, BELIEVE IT."

My religious teachings state that the supernatural cannot directly harm us, only trick and manipulate us, so I worked to keep them out of my mind and to let go of any racing thoughts of what to do or not to do and just made myself carry on as normal but avoiding the area just in case. After a few months the energy dissipated. It felt like it basically dissolved into the air and eventually disappeared entirely. It was a new home I'd just moved into and now it feels all fine. Don't know if it's related but the previous tenant of the house died soon after I moved in. I think the previous owner of the house (their landlord) had ended his lease for bullshit reasons too. He may have been upset if it was him"

I'll share the two extremes ones i.e the easist to resist / hardest. I was fully conscious both times. I probably slipped out of my body and this allowed them to \"interact\" with me. Idk what I looked like but i was basically just a set of eyes. FIRSTI spawned on a small path that lead to a village dirt road. i was behind a fence and not visible to ppl on the main dirt road, if we faced in the same direction. Two small gipsy-presenting boys (they can shapeshift to whatever race/age), around 5? y.o playing/ joking with each other appeared from behind the fence. They could not see me. Immediately my heart started beating really fast and I was panicking. They stopped and turned around. My body which was already invisible was petrified instantly. It's like the air turned into nails and just held me still. I knew I had to move to cross myself or ask for God but it's like I was sealed. I just had this awareness that I could still move my eyes so I crossed myself with my eyes and the entire scene just burst into nothingness. I woke up."

I'll keep it short. In the dream, I was in my hometown at night, sliding very low on the pavement. My body felt like a cloud of gas with two eyes. It was night but I could see everything.Everything was dark but in high contrast so I could perceive everything. I was very close to one of my relative's house and I was looking through the fence at her yard but the objects were strange, like the space was messed up somehow. For example she has an old school water well in her yard but in my dream it was hanging in the air and you had to climb a spiral staircase to reach the fountain and get water. It made no sense, the fountain was disconnected from the ground, how could there be water? I was just standing there, looking at it. And then, two beings came upon me. First, these dreams are very rare, maybe 3 to 5 years apart or even further. The demons were always male and came in pairs. Once two beautiful blond 17-18? y.o, once two gypsy 5 y.o and once older black men. The two blonde ones actually used glamour to shimmer in the night, but I digress. The worst ones I encountered were women-like. I don't remember what their features looked like, just the texture of their bodies. I shudder just thinking about it. I don't even know to to express it. It's like they were sculpted from wood, fully dressed, and painted over in color. The cloak of the one in the front was blue, like a sky blue. The one slightly behind her was in darker colors. Thinking back, she must have been lower in the ranking or a follower of some sort. They were dressed like bible people or roman fashion, idk. They moved normally but I knew they were wood because of the cracks in their bodies. Also, i think the paint was chipped here and there and I could see the brown wood underneath. I think the face was chipped also. I can't remember what they were wearing on their head. It must have been a head covering of sort but I think the hair was visible. Sculpted wood hair. Their faces, as they gazed upon me were so cruel. The smile… not perverted but really corrupt. They weren't taller than average women, but I was looking up at them like they were ski scrapers, that's how big the difference between us were. There was so much hatred and oppression in their faces, it felt like an entire building fell on my body. I woke up in my studio apartment at that time, bursting into tears, my read body going crazy from fear. I'll never forget it."

I used to throw fits in the car whenever we drove on that one section. I grew out of it, of course, but years later I learned that when they were constructing that road, they built it over a graveyard and neglected to move any of the bodies, only the headstones. Now when I visit, I try to drive very very slowly over that portion of the road because I don't want to disturb anybody beneath it."

It's like a little square and one one side there's a medieval gate into a pakt where's a castle and on the other side there's a mini zoo for injured wildlife. For couple of years anytime I went there I fainted or got close to fainting. Very strange because I never fainted anytime anywhere. Now that I'm an adult I can go there no problem. I also sometimes sence when I'm outside that there's a dead animal near. Not my the smell lol it's usually more far away to smell it, but it's like something leads me to the dead animal if I don't focus on where I'm going and just wander."

I haven't been in years and I feel guilty for not visiting her resting place but I don't like the energy there. It feels heavy. I worked at a school that had this oppressive feel over it. A dark cloud. I hated it there and only worked there a year. It was the worst teaching year as well as personal year of my life. Everything about the place was just off.I had a neighbor who was an energy vampire. She was too overbearing, too much, had crazy, manic eyes. My first few interactions with her just being friendly trying to welcome her absolutely zapped me, so I stopped contact and mentally put on a suit of armor if I HAD to deal with her. She had bad energy, and as an energy vampire she would attempt to take it from anyone. Smothering, overwhelming, demanding. The frigging yard man banged on my door one morning freaked out about her.As a child I woke up to see a tall dark figure in my doorway. It was broad, had horns, and was nearly as tall as the door. I threw the covers over my head, then peeked out. It had come closer. So like any child, I yelled for my mom.The next incident was the worst. Again, as a child, my dad was gone somewhere so I was sleeping in their bed with Mom. In my sleep I remember something whispering in my ear, \"Hit her.\" I resisted and didn't, and the whisper told me to again. So in my sleep or twilight sleep I hit her in the stomach. I've never felt so guilty. Ever.I hope the shadow figure and the whisper were just weird figments of an overactive child's imagination. In my teenage years my dog stood in my doorway and stared and growled at something in my room when I was home alone and in a different room but could see him. I haven't had anymore experiences like that and as I've gotten older and I've visited their home when they weren't there I have conducted actions and spoken things for protection although I don't feel anything dark there and never have.I truly believe there is bad, negative energy in places and in people. When it's in places idk if it's a place of bad things have occurred, unresolved anger or trauma, burial grounds, or even some kind of portal or cursed land."
