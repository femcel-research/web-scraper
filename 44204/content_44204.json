You just played mmorpg games and met the people of your Guild/Clan/etc but this days everyone is a dick. I guess discords is your best bet but do not go into any of the 4chan discords or others with sexually frustrated retarded moids. Just lurk for a hobby you like in here: https://disboard.org/searchDon't even reveal to people that you are a woman to get to know them well unless you want retarded simps to pay you for discord nitro, that happened to me once a suicidal moid gave me discord nitro and I talked him out of suicide he was Irish or something, I obviously don't talk to him anymore I know better. It sucks though you can just use emotes from other servers anywhere that's the only benefit you get."

We've always liked each other since the first time we talked but just hit it off lately after so many months of hesitation to confess our feelings for each other. I remember I always had moments thinking if he was flirting but at the same time shook the idea off as I didn't want to fall for someone who sleeps at the time I wake up and wakes up at the time I'm off to sleep. I honestly see him as the ideal partner I've been looking for in a guy. He ticks off the ideal partner list just as easily but distance is a bitch. I love him but I know I can't be looking at this optimistically. I just hope if we ever \"break up\", we can stay as friends-I find our connection that irreplaceable."

      "content": "Anonymous 10/29/20 (Thu) 12:19:38 AM46143My story to give some people hope.I was semi-dating a really shitty guy at a point when I started watching horror movie streams on 4/x/. People would take turns streaming their favourite movies and we'd comment on them in chat. There was an Australian guy who hosted often that had this deep, smooth voice that just made me melt and would always have me laughing hysterically with his commentary. I developed a kind of fixation on him, and when the regulars in these streams decided to start hanging out, I joined their skype group. We became a pretty close group of international friends and got along really well. I developed a crush on the Australian guy, J, and the more we talked, the more perfect he seemed. He was just so humble, funny, cute and smart. Most importantly, he treated me with actual respect. He treated me as an equal and never looked down on me for my shortcomings. I'd never experienced that before from anyone.Eventually, after knowing each other for about 6 months, we decided to arrange a big group meeting somewhere central, so we chose the Netherlands. J got there a couple of days earlier than the rest of us and offered to pick me up. I tried to decline, because I had a deep crush on him and didn't want his first time seeing me to be hot, sweaty in casual clothes and no makeup, but my message didn't send and when I got off the station, he was there waiting. He was just so handsome and gigantic in real life. He walked over, and I expected a hug, but he lifted me up and spun me around like my fat ass weighed nothing. We spent the next week together, always finding time alone, often cuddling on the couch, being the designated cooks ect. I just started to fall in love because all my fears, about how his personality was just what he presented online, started to vanish. I thought about telling him how I felt, but I was so fucking terrified he would reject me and I wouldn't be able to just swim in this deep pool of feelings I had for him. Eventually we all had to go home, and as I was going back to the station, one of the other girls from the group stayed behind. I was told later that she had started flirting with J and they spent the last night together in his room.I got home, cried, screamed at trees, then drank some vodka and told him how I felt, my logic being that I was now basically in a standoff and the first person to be romantically available wins. He was laughed awkwardly and said \"Oh, I had no idea\". I wanted to kill myself then and there, but he followed it up with \"I didn't think you would ever want someone like me\". We talked and he promised they'd just slept in the same bed, and he'd very tenderly rejected her. It honestly didn't matter at that point because he'd finally said he liked me.We started e-dating, but the more we shared pictures and started acting like a couple, the more desperate I became. I decided to buy a ticket to his awful, hot, humid country and go stay with him for as long as immigration would let me. When he met me at the terminal, lifted me up and kissed me, suddenly all that pent up energy from months spent away from each other reached a critical point and the nice, romantic walk along the rivers and whatnot would have to wait. We got back to his place and I had sex with someone I loved for the first time. I'd never really considered just how amazing being with someone so compatible, and with whom you share such a deep love for, could be. We spent two weeks together, and at that point there was so turning back.Eventually I had to go home, but there I was living on neetbux in a shitty one bedroom flat in a terrible, tiny town, drinking heavily and going no where. I wanted to get serious, but J is not a serious man. He was more than willing to fly back and forth, but actually making a change was difficult for him. Eventually I had to force his hand. He finished his bachelors, found a place for his masters, his uncle sponsored me for a work visa and we moved to Melbourne together. All in all, we only spent a month together, out of the more than 2.5 years we were dating. We've had our ups and downs, and there was a point where money was such an issue we thought we'd never see each other again, and neither of us wanted the other to be trapped in a dying relationship. Thankfully we managed."

It's a childish thing where for all intents and purposes we are boyfriend and girlfriend but declaring it that way openly to others feels cringy. Our friends and family know that we have feelings for each other and that we're waiting until we can see each other and we interact with each other's friend circles. >>44882I understand where you're coming from and I wouldn't have considered being like this until now, but covid plays a big part in it. As for talking to other people, I'm not and he's a khhv with exclusively male friends.

But yesterday we talked about this stuff again and, well, one thing lead to another and we are basically dating now. Some of which may involve me crying for fifteen minutes.I mean it's not even like anything is going to change, we talked about naughty things before and mostly it's like that other Anon said before> I like hearing about what excites him/bores him/amuses him. I think even if we weren’t dating he would still be my favorite person to spend time with.It's exactly this what I am feeling. Well and I guess it helps that he never asked for underwear. Wtf. But anyways, telling each other \"I love you\" on the telephone is pretty much the most wild thing I have ever experienced. I don't even care if we will ever meet in person, I mean I want to, but even if we don't, what I am experiencing right now is so powerful I would not even mind."

Do you and your bf have plans to meet in person?Are you serious about making this work as it can work as long as (you) and him try but on your own it may not work.Again, he has to be committed to it.>I've realized that I have a lot of doubt about my authenticity; am I being \"myself,\" like… I use photos of me, but they're static image, posed in very particular angles to conceal my flaws. How far into the relationship were you showing pictures to each other?I am very strange but do not understand why people need to show pictures unless at a point where they already like each others minds.Why have a man who only likes you for what you look like?How real are you with him vice versa as in do you share all your emotional feelings with each other or not?OP the only thing standing in your way is your BF being committed.Either lockdown on meeting or think of ending this thing if he has no intention.It is cruel of him not to be taking your relationship as serious as you do.It all rests on him.It is worrisome if he really does not let anyone know he is with you because he could cheat on you and justify it.This all depends on him and you know him better than any anon on here.I understand he is like anxious and all insecure but do you really want to be with someone that is so spineless?Give details maybe so we can figure this out more.If he watches porn I would be worried but like all men do probably.."

Of course I never did anything because we both were taken, but I know that feeling of loneliness and that painful longing for physical touch, closeness, and intimacy. I think you should openly communicate to your LDR bf that him not telling people about you makes you think he’s not as serious about the relationship and “doesn’t see it as real.” If he doesn’t validate your concerns then I would think about the future of the relationship."

We've met befofe in real life a few times, but he was dating someone else at the time so I thought he never paid much attention to me.It feels like I'm always trying to get past mental hurdles when it comes to him.We both had crushes on each other for about a year, but of course, neither of us knew. I'm a khv so I have a bad habit of falling for guys who are nice and friendly towards me, so in trying to get past that, I had convinced myself that he didn't like me, he was just being nice. For a whole year. Until it got blatant enough that I just had to ask and sure enough, he did.Another hurdle for the longest time was, yknow, knowing if he actually would like me. The real me. The chubby frumpy third wheeler who got drunk at the bonfire we had on the beach and cried in the sand because of how forever alone I was.But he comforted me back then.And he still does.And he told me that he loves me no matter what, despite all my flaws and weaknesses.And even though I'm naturally very suspicious and self-deprecating, I realizedhe really does love me. He really loves the real me.He's really… the best guy I've ever dated.The next hurdle is something neither of us can control, though. Covid.I live in California, he lives in Washington.I hope to god everything works out. Because I don't ever want to lose him. I've made so many strides because of him, mentally.

A big part of government insurance is \"keeping your standard of living\" - that mostly means making sure you can stay in your home. My dad was unemployed due to an accident for most of my youth and I never noticed that I was \"lower class\" because I still had enough food and we never had to worry about losing the house. Our poverty was handed down clothes, no vacation and sometimes no car."

I've been with my partner almost a year and soon he will be moving away to live in an area that he actually likes and a preferable job situation (he's a paramedic, wanting to work by the coast rather than in a city). Only a 3/4 hour train ride away so not thousands of miles but I'm still upset naturally. The plan is for me to move to him (all going well ofc) once I finish college next summer. Are there any tips for coping with the distance? Keeping things positive and developing the relationship? We online game together, have phone calls and message each other if we can't spend time together (things we intend to keep doing when we're apart) but obviously a busy work/education schedule is a bit different to actual long physical distance so are there any other things we could do?"

A lot of the users there are terrible people and finding a person you would like to be friends with, let alone partners with is like finding a diamond in the rough. I was just lucky enough for that to happen. If you want my advice, go to the social communities you like and just try to make friends in the natural way then go from there and see if you can find someone you really connect with.

She loved all of the same little niche things I did, and we would talk for hours every night and never run out of conversation, and it kept on for months, just getting deeper and deeper.  Everyone else I've talked to I eventually started getting stressed out not knowing what to say any more, but with her it just never faded and it felt like it never would.  The interests we shared made me feel like I could open up a huge part of myself and include them in it all and be motivated to engage even more in what I loved, and her thoughtfulness was unlike anyone I'd ever met in person.  We made plans to meet up across the world, I spent nearly everything I had on tickets and a hotel and left myself with only a small budget for food when I got back home, but coronavirus hit right at that moment and cancelled our tickets, and she was crushed and lashed out at me and broke everything off while treating me like some horribly manipulative person that didn't actually love her.  I knew how she could be and that it was all the emotional pain causing her to close off and act distrusting, but it took months for the behavior to stop and I'd been so hurt from it that we just couldn't reconnect in the same way after, and I knew that we probably shouldn't anyway.I've been in three relationships before, and nothing made me feel like this.  I don't long for her any more, but she did make me realize how things can be and the intensity of connection that you can actually find in someone.  It's kind of a security, because my other relationships there was always that question in my mind wondering if this is just how things are supposed to be, and I never really thought I would get an answer."

I don't think it is. I'm assuming you guys have met a bunch and have a feel for each other.

If neither of you are ready then that needs to be communicated. This might be obvious but if you do end up deciding to move to him, make sure you have a bunch of money saved up so if things end up sour you won't be trapped with no way to get out and get back to your home country.Good luck"

The problem only comes up once in a while but I can tell it lives rent-free in his head–the idea that my decision to date him doesn't mean much, while his does (which frustrates me)>that I haven't lived life yet, versus him allegedly talking to 100s of people and being friends with many; i.e., he's traveled to a few countries with friends, worked many jobs, had many experiences, while I've been \"having BDD and being insecure\" (true)>\"it feels like I chose to be with you while you're just stranded with me\", saying he just wants the best for me and is worried>he even has been hit on unlike me because he's more attractive yet seems convinced I'm a 10/10 in all the ways besides my insecuritiesHe insists that I could get any guy I wanted and be adored. Look. Only girls have liked me even tho I'm not gay. I feel like some sort of imposter or catfish :/His advice? to get to know more people with the implication that I should talk to other guys…and I find it uncomfy/weird.I've been trying. Still, I am the type of person who at age 13 was completely satisfied with having 1 amazing friend and never had a crush. My heart tells me that I just want to voice chat with him more. And…I want to webcam with him more. Us talking, him laughing, seeing him light up more. It's wonderful. I adore him.  But, he has a point. I have never \"known\" a guy irl. I just have made a few laugh with bad jokes in class a long time ago. Been years since I talked to another guy online–I talked to a few around when I first met him, briefly. I haven't had many female friends either. I've been introverted in the past years, satisfied with my childhood best friend. I was bullied by boys over being an \"ugly freak\" growing up…and in my adulthood the only times guys make contact with me is to call me ugly or a \"tranny.\" I still carry the visceral fear of it happening again within me. I'm guilty because I'm not as desirable as he thinks. And, confession: I sincerely believe if not for him…I will be alone forever. Because, well, I'm fine with that, and, quite frankly, the chances of me actually finding another guy that really likes me for me is pretty much impossible. However, I love him and I think I really lucked out with him. In the meantime, he thinks that I must have a mental health condition that literally warps my self-image or can't see how wonderful I am. And, look, I think I kind of suck otherwise? I don't whine about it. I want to have fun, connect to him, try my best, and be optimistic–in spite of my issues. But nothing will change the fact that I'm nothing special–at worse, annoying. And, that I know that even if I tried,  I know I would crash and burn at trying to make a connection with another guy. And, above all, this just makes me worry he won't actually like me when we meet up in person because his expectations are just so high."

I'm sorry to say this, but it's always a very bad sign when a guy suggests that. He's probably preparing to leave and may even have someone lined up already. Trust your gut, it's normal to feel \"uncomfy\" with this, most people would get livid at that suggestion. Anon I suggest asking him to make his wishes clear, try to gauge if he'd be upset at all if you went ahead and talked to other guys.

He wanted to meet up months into knowing me a long time ago but it was me back then that was reluctant as I was even more insecure and I felt like I had to self-improve before meeting him….also I barely knew him and things felt like they were moving too fast. Obviously that didn't turn out well as things got busier. I think mostly it's just expanding my social circle. But there's a little bit of the implying that I have never really seen what's out there. I don't think he actually expects me to flirt.Best case scenario, I guess, he really is being insecure about things and wants to feel like the relationship means something. There's more context to it. He's admitted that he feels burnt out on life and…he's been showing enthusiasm about us but he's dropped the ball in a lot of other areas in obvious ways. Also I made a mistake that maybe scarred him that I'm also guilty about. Years ago when I first talked to guys I added many. And I was casually flirting with a few not really realizing what flirting really meant. Looking back I literally had no standards and was excited by talking to guys for the first time. It wasn't like I was sending my ass to people or something, though I had crushes. He (was in his mid 20s while I was 21) got super serious about me pretty early on (another red flag probably) while I was still surprise pikachu'ing at all the guys. He was the one that pursued me the most and the most consistently fun and enjoyable.A while back (after the incident) he ended up breaking up with me after being heartbroken.Later I ended up slowly stopping talking to the others when I felt more serious about him and I ended up becoming pretty antisocial. He is now the only guy I've talked to in years. And it's still, if nothing else, true that I actually didn't get to know any guys in any truly meaningful context besides him."

He seems to want kids and that's a no from me. I feel kind of bad because a few years ago we were more on the same page (no kids) but he's gone more in the direction of saying that he 100% expects kids in the past few months…and he's relatively better adjusted than me with a more balanced life…so I feel guilty now. I should have never tried. I feel kind of a mixture of relieved and saddened by my decision. I'm in my late 20s and extremely socially awkward and I honestly doubt I'll find anyone that genuinely prefers me like he did (after talking 1000s of hours over VC and text I completely understand it).

      "content": "Anonymous 11/27/21 (Sat) 09:10:58 PM69524I've broken up with my long-distance bf a week ago. We'd dated for 2 years, known each other for 6 years. We met when we were 14 in my hometown, but later I moved to the capital city. There's 2500 km between us. We only met twice since we've separated. We had everything planned out, even wanted to marry each other. We agreed that he would save money and move to the capital city, since our hometown is shit and I also have studies in the capital. In the last few months I've grown really frustrated with our relationship. I think this is partly because I got close to a groupmate whom I really like, even though we're just friends and he tries to date another girl, we still spend a lot of time together and get really affectionate at times. I felt like my relationship with my bf is even more intangible than that with my friend, even though I'm more emotionally close to my bf. I also got disinterested in him, for the last few months our conversations are basically nothing of substance, just sending each other pics of cute animals. Other than that, my bf is very emotionally unstable and whenever I left him for more than two hours he started having panic attacks. All in all, problems kept piling up, we had a talk and I said that I need some time alone from him to figure things out and warned that we might break up. We didn't talk, aside from a couple of occasions, for two weeks. I'm ashamed to admit that I actually felt much better without him, I was more free and stopped worrying about a lot of things that came with our relationship. I told him this and also that I liked my friend and we broke things off. Now I feel extremely guilty, I feel like I hurt him with my decision, and even though I feel much better I know that he feels much worse. Recently he told me that he would kill himself eventually and I didn't know how to react. His whole life was dedicated to me and built around me and now that I've left I feel like I ruined it.Another note: now that I'm single I feel like… nothing has changed actually? I'm just as alone as I've been before and maybe that shows that our relationship got lackluster. Idk."

He has a history of self-harm as well and I remember at some point in our relationship he said that if i didn't exist he would have killed himself long ago. I feel like I'm the only thing keeping him afloat. Which is def not healthy.>the last thing I would do is just…let him know?I think you're right about this one, my initial reaction was \"why would you tell me this\" because it definitely made me feel worse and he knew it. Not only that, he actually described his suicide plans in great detail and it was awful.>moreover, if he wasn't learning how to better manage his issues, the relationship was dead in the waterWhen we had \"the talk\" he said that he would change so that I wouldn't leave and he asked to give more time, so I feel kind of like a dick for not giving him a chance.>in general you could have handled it better but, yes, you were honest.We had 100% honesty policy in our relationship. Maybe that's partly the reason why he told me about his suicide plans.>also please maybe don't idealize what you have with your friend either, like, he's trying to date a girl and getting affectionate with you is textbook sus.Maybe I didn't make it clear enough, he's not dating anyone at the moment, just chatting with a girl he likes and wants to date. Generally I don't think he views me as his possible gf but I'm fine with that, I wouldn't want a relationship with him either (not a long-term one at very least), even though I like him. It just feels refreshing to receive any kind of attention and affection, even platonic, in real life, which I have never experienced before (this LDR was my first relationship in general)."

I don't think there was much left you could of done, he needs professional help. this suicide thing is probably like a script to him at this point (not that it's fake). and this is more out there so take it with a grain of salt…but with guys with issues, many actually significantly improve once they have someone. your ex just isn't that type. also good to know about your friend."

That doesn't mean jack shit for the future, but that means there's doors open for further communication on the matter.

We still talk to each other. I´ve always liked him…a lot. I haven´t met another person which is more fun talking to than him. He is constantly in my head. But here ist the thing, we haven´t met each other…yet. And I can´t bear it anymore.There has always been this attraction between us since the beginning. We both have uttered the wish to be in each other´s company. But he hasn´t 100% agreed to meet yet, because he doesn´t want to force it. It wouldn´t feel right to him if I would just come for a visit and vanish afterwards. Either there has to be a way to be live next to each other or we shouldn´t meet. But I can´t wait anymore. I´m struggeling with a lot of decisions at the moment but the one thing I´m sure about is, that I want to finally meet him. I´ve had this urge for such a long time, it is becoming unbearable. I aware that the person I´m in love with is partly a construct of my imagination because I didn´t get him to now in real life yet. That´s why I want to meet him. I want to get to know his real self. I want to know if I would still love him, if we could be together. I feel trapped. On one side he doesn´t want to meet me like this but on the other side I can´t get him out of my head and I can´t move on from him. That´s why I´ve made the decision to visit him some time ago. Initially I felt relief when I made the decision. It´s like an 9h train ride to a neighbour country so the distance is managable. I haven´t really told him about my plans. We talked about the topic some time ago and he still thinks it not the right time for a meeting. That´s why I´m questioning my decision.I don´t know what to do. I don´t want to loose him but every time we talk I feel the pain of him not being with me. Sometimes all I want is just to talk to him. Should I just go for it or leave it be?"

I’m sure I posted this before in another thread, but during the long distance relationships I’ve had, I’ve always ended up having look to around my room for things to sell just to make some money to visit them every couple of months. Then when you get there, it seems a waste to just sit around so you have to pay to do a bunch of things too.It’s basically like having a gambling addiction. You pour so much, money, time, energy into it because you’re “addicted” to them and have come this far but you can lose it all at any moment. It’s also harder to read the person’s feelings when you are not there in person so a break up can feel more sudden or unexpected. The contrast between seeing them 24/7 for a week and then not at all for a few weeks can be difficult too and each trip gets wasted a bit while you adjust. Then you have adjust again when you come back. You also have to consider that you are putting a huge amount of personal info and photos online, even of it is in private chats. Pretty much everything gets hacked these days. I think the only time it is worth it is if you already have a long term established relationship and are only going long distance for a set amount of time and have planned and budgeted trips in advance."

I often react to what I want to seconds after it's said. the rare times he responds to what I say about what he said…it feels weird and many minutes later. he isn't always like this but it's like he goes into a mode where he ignores me and just goes on–  it's also like something he could say to anyone else on the subject–because it relates to nothing personal besides a piece of media he's saying his take about. I have said to him that feeling unheard is a sore spot because my mom has spoken over me so much–I stopped talking altogether while she talks all the time. That the last time I tried even saying anything at all to her, after she stopped her point for a few seconds, she immediately continued her next point while I was still mid-sentence, as if I never even said anything. For every 100 words she says, I probably say 1 word on average. This isn't hyperbole. I barely talk at all. I have gone days without speaking a word aloud before. I went through 10 years of speech therapy FFS. 10. years.   My ebf accused of just \"projecting\" and that I am the one that talks all the time without letting the other person speak…that I might just be like my mom which made me feel ashamed. I remember looking back at that conversation…it was a text wall from him with 0 relation to the 2 lines I dropped, minutes apart, as compared to 100s of his. he has told me \"this is just what a conversation is\", among other things, and idk what to think anymore. I usually love enthusiasm in people. I genuinely get excited when I see someone being passionate about something and I love joining in, and have so many times. I have so much fun. And they have usually made me feel included and like we're having a real conversation about it. I never have felt like I needed to interject ever before with online stuff with people I've chosen to talk to for a long time. Looking back I never said more than the other person. They usually drove the conversation, yet, I didn't feel like some audience member? If that makes sense. Think the last time around I said to my ebf, \"look, if we were talking in real life, with our voices, if I said something would you go on with your initial point without considering it?\" and he said yes. And I don't know what to make of it or if I'm acting entitled…because again I've never ran into any such issue with any of my friends and I don't even know what proper behavior is anymore."

And I feel so rude doing it! Let me put it straight. It's just not fun at all. It's ok if he's just being excited about something but when it's a text wall of negativity or criticism, it's…oof.   Think the only times he addresses what I say in the moment when he's like this is when it's sex-related or something. Other than all that, he is actually kind of perfect for me other than weird problems like this, ones that make me wonder about the way he sees me or other people.

He's been complaining about anti-Russia propaganda bots in the past day…he hasn't explicitly said so but I think he's in support of the war on Ukraine.  Weird considering he shit so much on warmongering before. I agreed with him on a lot of controversial topics in the pass. This, though…sigh. For a while I've been getting the inkling feeling that I can't really trust him or what he feels about things. I'm kind of depressed more than anything. Imagine spending half your 20s talking to one guy, and spending 1000s of hours with him playing games and chatting and whatever, and the first meet-up being soon…and it probably just floating off into the air. Imagine finding someone that shares so many of your vulnerable sentiments.  I should have known better tbh. I am someone unlovable, I knew this by when I was 10 years old because of how my parents and other people treated me. I ended up finding him late in college on a weird forum and we naturally grew to really like one another…I focused on how real and strong our connection felt, and how much he adored me, the extents he went for me at my worst. The lazy nights snowball fighting in dumb games and us excitedly showing one another secret places. How enthusiastic yet level-headed he was. His adorable stories about his past in his hometown and being a bullheaded dummy, but so earnest about it all.Sorry about the tangent. I'm bad with words and I guess I really wanted this to work out because it was really my one chance at something genuinely special with a guy."

It seems like you are on the fence if you're nervous moving away from your parents. However, you also don't like the long distance aspect. Maybe give it a test drive, \"move in\" for a month (just a visit). Except, I think that it may not be worth it with his new camp job because then you won't be able to see him as much as you want. Maybe take a visit when he has 5 days off? I always say go for a test drive. You dunno how your ldr bf will act irl if you haven't seen him that much.I have a ldr bf I moved in with and after about ~7 months, true colours come out lol. He's from Vancouver and I was from Toronto. I moved in with him and it was awful. We didn't have any movers because cheap/poor so we had to lift all the heavy furniture - the worst being the couch and mattress. Buying all the cleaning supplies, furniture, groceries, splitting bills, etc. was a nightmare, but I have to say if you love him, it is worth it because you get to fall asleep and wake up next to your bf everyday! I do get lonely still when he goes off to work (I am a NEET at this time while he works standard 9-5 job)"

We met off of leddit but then I never checked his history and he had been posting personals for 5 years on there. He only got two responses total he showed me. I've been in LDRs and non-LDRs, but now that I think about it, I wonder if these guys who opt for only online and only do LDRs are just red flags themselves. I'm worried my bf doesn't actually love me, but I am just here in the meantime to keep him company. He told me one of his friends giving dating advice was just to get \"practice\". All his friends are the worst I could think of if birds of a feather fly together, they're all bitter and divorced with issues in regards to any woman. Something about this irks me beyond anything, but I feel I can not say much without looking paranoid. After this relationship ends, I will never do another LDR (excluding if they need to travel after in person such as family abroad emergency for a defined time). I think those into LDRs get into it because in person, there's a reason why nobody else wanted them."

I live in a ghetto-like place so it plays a role. I agree that many people, especially moids since for girls it's easier to find relationships, get into LDRs because they have issues with in person interactions. The ideal would be to make sure your bf sincerely likes you and isn't settling for LDR bc he cant get an irl. That's very hard to find out though and exceptionally rare among scrotes, who mostly go for convenience and something is better than nothing. But if your LDR bf is with you because he actually, truly loves you, and not because he cant go for irl, then he's likely far more of a keeper than men in irl relationships."

He's smart, handsome, masculine, charming, has his life together and I'm honestly not sure what he wants from me. Im just ok looking, super awkward and dont really have much going on in my life. He has a good career and is active socially. We talked about sexual topics a few times and he tried to steer more in that direction but backs off when I get uncomfortable. I'm afraid ill give in and he'll just abandon me after he gets nudes or i fall for him. I just dont see a reason for him looking for girls online, especially me. he has no red flags or issues and it makes me wonder why tf are you on here??

I made an excuse to leave so I could go cry, idk what to do. He's perfect and I just want to throw myself at him. He's not hiding his intentions which im happy about but I dont just want to talk you DUMMY. Then he posted a pic of his BIG ARMS building a hut in the woods and said \"yurt BF, teepee GF\" which made me laugh while I was sobbing which made me even more sad. I want to get closer to him but I feel like the only way I can is by accepting his sexual advances, or I keep things the way the are now and just hold myself back every time I talk to him until he decides to commit. We've only been talking for a few weeks. I havent felt this emotional over a moid ever."

It was really rough for the first few years of only getting to see each other a couple of times in person, but we would video call every single day, even if only to say good night to one another. It was a bit of an adjustment going from LDR to irl, but we've been doing great. I think the main thing for me to adjust to is not really being able to \"get away\" the way that I used to, like just being on my own when I needed me time. We both work from home so he's always here which the majority of the time I love but it can feel a bit stifling when I get into a mood where I want to be isolated. Overall though, this is the best thing that has ever happened to me. The wait was difficult but worth it, and the time we spent unable to be in person together was instead spent saving up money so we're living very comfortably now. I'm so ridiculously happy."

I wouldnt say we talk constantly, juts when we have free time to, which i find reasonable, we both come home tired after all. But we're not in an LDR, but i think my post belongs in this thread anyway.Tbh, talking to him makes my loneliness all the more apparent because we live so far from each other, and I have never experienced that level of attraction in real life before.As time went on we started to open up to each other more often, he told me how he wants to find someone who loves him, but he'll probably be alone forever (which I don't really believe, he's not ugly at all, he just never approaches anyone). It kinda made me feel bad at first, because I do love him, maybe not as a real boyfriend, but as close as it gets. I wished him good luck with finding a partner, but I can't help but admit I hope he doesn't find anyone, I want him to stay mine. I love how morose he is, how he has low self esteem but he's actually attractive.I'm still thinking about meeting him some day, but its' stupid to think about it.. My parents won't let me travel even to another city, let alone a country, all alone. And my job is so pathetic I would have to never spend money on anything just to be able to afford tickets. But i still think about seeing him a lot.I know I'm starting to vent more than talking about my pseudo LD relationship here, but i desire physical touch so badly, I want to do all the things we talked about doing so badly. I see my coworkers and friends getting hit on often, talking about their boyfriends and exes, while I'm here a kissless virgin that no one showed any interest in, no matter how much i take care of myself or how much i try to behave less like an autistic weirdo.He's probably as close as I'll get to having a boyfriend…"

There's just so many things that have piled on making me Sometimes we get into disagreements and he ends up doing something like…ok…Imagine someone that says \"completely equal\" and \"50-50\" in response to something that is more like 95-5….something that it is so technical it could be proven wrong by doing a count on a few archive sites, or something like that. And, imagine that this is the default way he argues, where it's usually based off of hyperbole he puts 0 stock and evidence in and then ignores 100% of anything I have to say in response. It has made pretty much all arguments into a mess where he says something outrageous every 10 seconds then ignores my refutes of it. I'm not sure if it makes me mad. More numb? Can we just not make progress? I'm starting to feel that way about many things…and it's not really just the arguments we have once every few weeks. It isn't really that I'm better, but as just some dumb weirdo who's never touched anyone before and is prepared to die alone, I guess this is all inevitable."

And this makes me uncomfortable about our ability as a couple to actually…idk…work through things, progress, etc. Communicating hasn't helped but maybe there's a better way?Also, it seems less like an annoyance and more something that will cause me massive amounts of stress down the line. I've had friends for many years and I have never run into these issues with them, either. The rare disagreements I get into feel much less like arguments and actually…two people talking instead of someone talking at the other? Sometimes, I actually ended up having my mind changed, or changed someone's. Or learned something new. Usually things end up somewhere. But with my bf, it's like…talking to a stranger, actually, and it's so weird and hard to explain. It's like going onto 4chan and arguing with a random guy. I have once before met someone like my bf irl and she was such a brick wall that I wasn't friends with her for very long and unlike so many other people I had met, it felt like I didn't \"click\" with her. I was surprised when I found out other people had been complaining about her bulldoze-y behavior because I had assumed I just wasn't tolerant enough. She was a huge liberal feminist–I had met others but none that extreme. Hearing that this is just normal when someone has dated someone for a long time puts me off of dating."

You need to think ahead to what your relationship will be in X years and if you have to have somebody move countries then make sure your relationship is strong enough to withstand it because moving countries is a much bigger deal than you can imagine.

He had delusions that he could provide structure and help us be better people but could barely take care of anything outside running his business. He didn't care to talk about music or movies or philosophy or anything outside his stupid business or his health problems. I also was briefly seeing a J last summer who was also a workaholic and so fucking boring and flaky as a result, and he was also constantly \"encouraging\" me to \"be better\" when I never asked. I also suspect that retard was mentally ill too because he told me his job was making him suicidal like 2 or less weeks after I met him. Maybe I should say I'll never date a mentally ill person again instead, but I've had such bad experiences with Js I don't have a problem just avoiding getting involved with them altogether.

In college I tried adding some guys off of 4chan and I think the conversation fizzled out so quickly. Sometimes I think it'd be nice to have someone to talk to, but the anxiety of talking to men and all the baggage that comes with that discourages me from doing so.

      "content": "Anonymous 02/23/23 (Thu) 04:19:51 PM96223>>96222I found him on /soc/ gf/bf finder threads. I was on /soc/ NON-LEWD (VERY IMPORTANT) friend finder threads for 8 months just churning out friend requests to find a SANE person to be friends with (I was extremely lonely during covid). But all the men on there are really just looking for a gf unless they specify \"NO WOMEN\". So I thought why the hell not I might as well try to find a boyfriend online since I'm spending so much time, effort and energy finding a friend, who ultimately ditches me cuz I'm not interested in a romantic relationship lol. Hence why I went on the gf/bf threads and I got my fiance on my first try. Throughout my quest to find a life-long friend, I found a pretty cool girl and we were pen pals for 4 months before she went offline due to a really bad breakup. She is with a new boyfriend now also on the verge of breaking up again, so I don't talk to her much but we are still in contact. It was nice to have a female friend who shares the same background and personality as me, sharing advice and wisdom with each other. So having my eyes assaulted by dick pics on /soc/ catalog was worth it LOL. I also had another male friend who wasn't interested in me romantically. Things kinda fizzled out though and he deleted me after I did not message him for 5 months (I didn't have the time anymore to chat with anyone after I moved in with my fiance). That anon was really interesting and I enjoyed our time spent together (he wasn't creepy at all and really witty and funny with good life advice - he was 29). So if things don't work out for you on /soc/, you may find some pretty cool people!There was a semi-sane moid on there too who was interested in me but it didn't work out cuz I called him out for his sexist bullshit, plus at the time I was still looking for friends only (which then made him lose interest in me). I argued that he should lower his standards and go for women with a body count of 1-2 (this was me speaking as a khhv) cuz otherwise he'd be alone if he went virgin hunting. He said he was only interested in virgins and didn't want to have a girlfriend who was in previous long-term committed relationships. But to me, I'm thinking, well - it's not like she was promiscuous and she did commit and put effort in her relationship but she just had bad luck and it didn't work out in the end. That was my argument and then he started to distance himself from me after that lol. He did eventually find his virgin tradwife gf who's into lolita fashion and started spamming the /soc/ threads a day sharing his jubilation and he was met with many angry jealous moids telling him to kys. But I guess she is another example of a NEET girl who got a bf just cuz she was a virgin and that's all he cared about. You get some crazy moids so be careful not to divulge too much info. Some guy rage quit on me because I wasn't interested in him even though many girls on there added him because he was sweet and innocent in his initial post and stated he owned a house at 24, but he really was just a wolf in sheep's clothing lol. I forget what he got angry over because it was so trivial but I didn't mind when he deleted me. Another moid kept showing his boogers at me whenever he got angry at me or told me to kms and got angry over little things (he had some major rage issues man) even though in his initial post he seemed pretty chill and innocent too. Of course I started distancing myself and eventually deleted my throwaway profile after that lol. You will get alot of adds if you state you are a woman, like 30-50 adds but only 1 or 2 are worth talking to. The cool 29 year old guy added me and didn't write a post, he was just a /soc/ tourist at the time. People who have /soc/ as their main visited board are insane.I was also friends with a Swedish guy who was normal and interesting to talk to. Learned so much about Sweden and he shared me trips to India he took at 15 (Swedes are so crazy and encourage their kids to go travelling alone at such a young age!). He shared me authentic Swedish recipes from his grandma and I wish I saved them lol. He was also from a very rich family and it was fascinating to see how they lived, he shared many pictures of his travels throughout Europe and his family's estates. Anyway he only messaged me like once a month which was too infrequent and I deleted him. Another guy from Vancouver was normal too and had an everyday life and job and all that - he didn't have much time for me either so he ghosted me unintentionally. A normie with a girlfriend in the UK talked to me for a bit but he was super boring and just talked about his job and sports. This was during covid so a lot of normies were on /soc/ at the time. Most guys on there are pretty desperate coomers who have a dream of getting a gf and /soc/ is the only way for them cuz they're neets. And I don't think you want a coomer neet. Thus, it's a pipe dream because unless you're very lucky its hard to move in together due to financial costs and if you're in separate countries, in addition to the fact that many of the users on /soc/ are pretty much coomer neets (i.e., the worst boyfriend). You will get a lot of clingy guys harassing you just cuz you put \"f\" in your post. Just ignore and delete and hope you get lucky finding interesting people to talk to or become a couple with.There was this other perpetually online guy I talked to who was semi normal. He had a job. Worked in tech. Kind of a simp for chicks and only added and talked to girls. He frequents lolcow and posts there. I made a post in the bf/gf thread and made it super generic cuz by then I had made TOO many posts to the point of being recognizable by all the people I ghosted/deleted. The anons on /soc/ are all bitter jaded and mean and will say false bad things about you so then no one adds you lol. So be careful about that! My fiance didnt add me but he also made a post and I remember thinking to myself - wow, what an interesting guy. And also I imagined how our life would be together with him based off his post lol. I added him cuz he was very obviously not a neet (and seemed kinda well established). And I thought to myself, wow he sounds so accomplished why the hell is he on this hellsite?! And I added him. And of course he accepted and I told him which post I was and he said that he wanted to add me but he didn't cuz too many people would add me and he thought he wouldn't have a chance. I am so happy I added him! it changed my life. I'm surprised no one else added him but I guess there weren't many femanons lurking that day. So lwe were pen pals for 7 months online and I gradually worked up the nerve to do phone calls and I hate my ugly face so much so I refused to do video calls after my first attempt. It was nice to verify he was real at least so definitely do that at least once! He was really nice about me just showing the wall so on our first video call I got to see his face and he just saw a wall lol. He was so super patient with me. I didn’t phone call him and let him hear my voice until two months of chatting everyday through text. It turned out he was living in the same city as me. I couldn't believe my luck! So meeting up was easy. He lived across the country though and was just in my city for school. I moved in with him a year later after we went on dates together. And we had the privilege of having his cottage to ourselves so we kinda practiced living together before officially moving in. His cottage was in the same province as where he was studying so it was really easy to live with him and have a mini summer vacation/honeymoon together. I hope anyone reading this will find someone and get lucky and hit the jackpot! I believe in fate after meeting my love on /soc/ of all places. But you never know if you don't try. Give it a shot but be cautious and stay safe! That said, I did have one creepy encounter where a guy just wanted feet pics from me. Just delete, block, move on. Don’t even interact with people like that."

I don't want to fall into the trap of dating someone because I'm lonely. And you're really brave for putting yourself out there! Was there a reason you decided to make your own post instead of just messaging people who you thought looked interesting? I really admire your dedication. I hope you can find yourself some life-long friends! Also reading about the guy who showed you his boogers when he was angry with you made me lol."

I struggle with this and expect to click with everyone immediately based on a few fluke experiences, but in reality building connection and friendship is going to take lots of work and maybe some lackluster conversations.

I made my own posts because I wanted people to know who they were adding.

I’d always say “why’d you add me” and then things would roll off that. >>96227Yeah just ask what they’re into, what is going on in their life, if they have any funny or interesting stories to tell etc. Some like phone calls only or video calls because they’re into Omegle.

I think I'm sort of accidentally rolling into a long distance relationship with a guy I met through 4chan (not via /soc/ or /r9k/). We sometimes have voice calls all day and I'm very quickly getting attached and it seems like he's getting attached too or maybe he's tricking me into becoming attached. We already talked about meeting up and going on a trip together. Plus he seems to sometimes imply that he'd be interested in marrying me. Idk if I'm just really naïve, because I've never been in a relationship before. I know guys will say that kind of stuff to trick girls into things, but he genuinely seems wholesome and not that kind of guy. He indulges me in my special interests and really gets into it too, which is very fun! He's also very handsome, kind and patient. Our morals and values line up very well, the religious stuff pretty much too. He's really a southern gentleman type."

That type of hesitancy and sexual dysfunction may not seem normal to someone who doesn't have my issues or trauma but to me it makes sense. I actually cried the same day I went to third base with him anyway because I felt this internally crushing guilt for enjoying it and like I should hate itIt's mostly penetration. I'm not a virgin but the times I've had sex haven't been good and majorly driven by coercion and me actually wanting to refuse it, or the relationship went down in flames even if it was remotely consensual. I've tried to cure my vaginal dysfunction through masturbating but most of the time a penis or a thought of anyone else penetrating me again except myself is still associated with my past trauma and I just want to leave it all behind.

I don't encourage you to do something that dramatic but if you really love this guy take control of your life and make a decision, stand up to your parents. Life is precious and short, true love is rare, I wish you the best of luck with your future."
