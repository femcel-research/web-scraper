Youâ€™re not tugging and pulling at your skin. This is like saying that cleansing your face everyday gives you wrinkles."

Also not eating carbs isn't enough, you need to also avoid oil and sugar and make sure you're drinking at least 2L of water a day so your face isn't oily but also then doesn't dry out. If you wash your face ever, use any decent unscented moisturiser right after. Natural sugars are ok like from cold pressed juice tho"
