The occasional fluff stuff has been nice, it felt nice to finally get swooned. I mostly take the bots on dnd style adventures and kill some monsters.I wish magic was real.I think a lot about getting my life back in order. I have a a lot of art that is unfinished that I want to really complete but the last time I try draw I had an life event to happen and it feels tainted."

Today I made cacio e pepe (have been obsessed with it since you only need to buy 3 ingredients), and I will make some pierogi too, as dessert. I like cooking so much, it helps me unwind, that I don't mind cooking for my flatmates even if I already ate and don't get to eat."

Dahmer's grin haunts the corners of thought,  With a Lolita complex, his desires are fraught.  Wired and geeked up, the psychos take flight,  Schizophrenic visions dance in the light.  9/11's echo hangs heavy like fog,  As shotas chase dreams, lost in the smog.  Cubs roam the alleys, innocence worn,  Powder gets you hyper, a new day is born.  Smoked out in the haze, where the lost often tread,  Fiddlesticks rattle in a world filled with dread.  Guro art spills like secrets untold,  Chuds lurk in corners while catgirls are bold.  Hatsune Miku sings as glowies watch close,  In Saddam's bunker, where shadows engross.  BBC broadcasts while ZOGbots align,  Zionists scheme in the depths of the night.  Jeffrey can't wait to see your fiddlesticks play,  I like boys. I'm gay."
