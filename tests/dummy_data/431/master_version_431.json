I'm also curious about how doing your oil cleanser after your normal cleanser is working out for you. Is there a reason you do it this way? I always thought an oil cleanser came first in a double cleanse because the oil soluble stuff can block your normal cleanser from actually cleansing the skin surface, but water soluble bits don't affect the oil cleanser from doing it's job."

I basically just use the pond's first to remove makeup, not really \"cleanse\", then I use the BHA before oil cleansing because it helps me to be able to massage the gunk out of my sebaceous filaments, then I use the pond's again to remove the mineral oil. An alternative would be to use an emulsifying oil cleanser so it can be rinsed off with just water (mixing a bit of Cromollient SCE in with your oil with allow it to be emulsified with water, cheaper than buying a commercial oil cleanser)."

I don't even lick my licks or anything, it's just prominent. If you miss sweet childrens cosmetics but want something more low key and sun concious to carry in your day to day, definetly try this."

I keep hair ties, clips and pins in the red and green Appletox and the peach hand cream containers. Oh and the Eggpore containers you can use as little plant pots after you're done - you push the little plastic yolk out of the top."

I'm mostly looking for products that aren't too expensive, the kind of things I've seen so far are either way too expensive for me (I'm a broke student so it doesn't help) or it's affordable but doesn't work whatsoever. I'm not looking for a major fix, just trying to get good habits and making my face slightly less oily and \"tired\" than it would be otherwise. I'm young (23), I heard it's better to look for more effective stuff while growing older, because then the skin will be different. I already tried some of the Eggpore products and I'd say the blackhead steam balm works but I'm not sure for the one that tighten pores because I never used other products that do the same thing before. >but they're definitely the kind of products you use to feel pampered and feminine, not necessarily because they actually work. I'm confused, does that mean that they don't work in general, or that they do work, but not as well as expected? Also I agree about the packaging, it's adorable."

My skin is usually pretty decent (maybe a couple of bumps and a bit of unevenness but it's nothing I worry about and it isn't noticeable) but recently my skin has turned into a complete shitshow! I have full on pimples all over my cheeks (if I do get pimples they're on my T-zone), also on and around my nose. My forehead is covered in hundreds of those pseudo pimples which are like mini cysts? Like it never really forms into a pimple but they're bumps everywhere and I have patchy redness all over my skin too. It happened around the time I moved a week ago, and the environment change has been more humidity, different water quality (harder water), and I'm staying in a house full of smokers. Oh and I JUST started my period which didn't help. I usually do some sort of pimple cream/face wash combo every other day and moisturizer every day. But that clearly hasn't stopped anything. Does anyone have any creams or washes I could buy to help stop this outbreak? I'm assuming the smoke is causing the worst of it but I have no idea."

I also used to have folliculitis/dermatitis which I mistook for acne on my forehead. Using a dandruff shampoo as my regular shampoo solved that problem though, along with the zinc in the serum I use"

I only wore makeup to cover up my terrible discolored skin but I think I need to embrace the fact I'm \"ugly\", and just focus on skincare to help me get better. Wearing makeup in addition to taking care of my skin felt like a waste of time since all the effort I put into my skincare was diminished by the layers n' layers of foundation I piled on afterwards. I have basically wore makeup everyday the last few months after being makeup free majority of my life…The only skin problem I had prior were discoloration and a few pimples on a forehead now I have acne scars in addition to my bumpy lumpy skin ;(. Here's NEW routine, I'll probably start it next week. I would appreciate critique :) Morning // Cetaphil cleanser // Citrus Humphrey's Witch Hazel Facial Toner // Amore Pacific enzyme exfoliant // Clindamycin lotion // Biore UV Aqua Rich SPF 50+ **As for makeup I'm just applying a concealer instead of foundation/powder. Night // Cetaphil cleanser // Citrus Humphrey's Witch Hazel Facial Toner // Retin A 0.5 // Hydroquinone **I'll probably alternate between a mask and sheet mask, making sure to apply it once a week. Oh I'm gonna cut out all meat unless it's fish, no more fast food, more water and less coffee. :) I'll keep yall updated once a month! Wish me luck guys~"

These days I just stick to a gentle twice-weekly facial shower scrub, vitamin E moisturiser, general SPF, hot lemon slice water, fancy teas and basic-ass water. It's nice to think that your skin is an oasis that can drink up all the friendly little compounds in the products you're slathering on your face, but the reality is that you're just choking/suffocating it.

I'm super allergic to everything so being able to choose products with only a few ingredients so I can narrow down triggers is great. Basically, the 10 step and other Korean superstitions/rituals are just marketing shit but getting into the fad really taught me a lot about skincare in the process and I'm not going to stop buying Korean and Japanese products any time soon because they're simple, effective, cheap and pleasantly quirky."

However, some people on the internet swear for it being the best thing ever for your skin so maybe it depends on the type of skin or wether you use soap or not. It personally did nothing for my blackheads or under the skin pimples, while some people says it helped them reduce them. I use it mostly in combination with the Avene Cleansing gel, since with only water i feel it does nothing, and it does leaves it a lot more foam-y (it doesn't really foam up that much with hands), so it could be a good thing if you got a product you wanna extend the life of. I'd say that for the price (it's around 4 eurs for both the white and black Missha ones on ebay from korea, or even on local stores from other brands, you'll find it for less than 5 $/€) to try it yourself and see if you like it, since it's a bit of divided opinion."

You are stripping your skin of natural oils, which is just as bad as not cleaning it ever. Your skin can handle itself just fine without that, if your skin is trying to remove a product actively, it means you've passed the \"too much\" mark long ago. Moderation, you people."

Herbivorous animals get B12 through the soil on plants and that's why meat and milk has B12 in it, we on the other hand don't eat dirt with our fruits and veggies so we need to rely on synthetic B12. I'm not sure if you meant it or not but you can't overdose on B12. Even with injections it's impossible. It can however mess up your skin bacteria and cause inflammation in high doses although this only seems to happens to some people. Luck of the draw I guess :( Don't give up on the supplements though, B12 is soooo important for your brain and blood. You just need 2.8 micrograms a day, you shouldn't have a reaction on that little a dose."

(my problem with sticking to a foundation or face makeup was that i'm mixed race and go from extremely pale in the winter to tan in the summer and so i would have times where my makeup didn't match me anymore lol) but i have noticed since turning 22 that my pores are getting bigger, especially on my nose, i've either got clogged pores/ sebacious filaments there or blackheads (no idea which one cause i'm super inexperienced with blemishes that aren't like basic whiteheads), and depending on how much sleep i'm getting i notice the presence of more prominent eye bags, crows feet and nasolabial folds. of course these are all pretty small, aren't yet permanent and i'm the only one looking at my face closely enough to even notice them, but STILL! getting older sucks and i'm not even that old relatively. my skin type has always been combination and turns dry or oily with the seasons. since it's fall i'm normal-oily everywhere but super dry/flaky on the nose/brow/forehead. i've been removing makeup with micellar water, cleansing with a foaming pore minimizing cleanser, toning with witch hazel and moisturizing only my dry areas. any more skin-routine experienced miners have advice? i have lots of face masks, from a drying clay mask to glossier's moon mask that's supposedly a heavy moisturizer, but i rarely use them. also sorry for rambling, and idk if this is just a personal/ latina issue but i think i'm getting even hairier than i've always been, which is great for my eyebrows but mortifying when i look close up at my fucking borderline beard that i have to bleach and trim"

Also, does anyone know how to get of those tiny blackheads on the nose (I think they're called sebaceous filaments)? I tried many many things but they either don't work or they end up reappearing after a few days. Lastly (sorry for so many questions), any recommendations on starting a proper skincare routine? Any brands that have good skincare but isn't too expensive? What products do you recommend? (I'm in skin is overall normal overall but I experience some occasional dryness in winter and oiliness in summer, I wanted say my skin is too sensitive and I experience some hormonal acne along my jaw/cheeks but nothing extremely major but in general I don't have anything major that bothers me apart from my p.i.e and nose blackheads, I just want to take care of my skin while I'm young and help prevent any damage to make sure my skin looks good as I get older)"

Products - chemical exfoliants work wonders for smoothing out the skin. I recommend glycolic acid and salicylic acid. (make sure that you wear sunscreen with it, though) - moisturizers: these can be humectants, which attract moisture, or occlusives, which prevent moisture from escaping. I don't know how dry your skin is, but the drier it is, the thicker your facial lotion should be. (and never ever use body lotion on your face) - sheet masks: these are good for special occasions or something you do once or twice a month. they're soaked in essence, which is full of ingredients that will make your skin appear plumper. - cleanser: you shouldn't be scrubbing your face that hard and expect it not to get sensitive and reddish. get a non-foaming cleanser (I use CeraVe hydrating). My routine is if you're interested."

AHA's even out your skin tone, reduce any sun damage, etc etc. I use Pixi glow peel pads. They're 20% glycolic acid which to some people is pretty intense, but you only leave it on for 2-3 minutes before neutralising it with water. I'd suggest at the start using that every 3 days just to see how your skin reacts, you will go through a purging process where little spots will appear but eventually this will go. You can increase how often you do it but just pay attention to how your skin reacts etc. You can also get 2% glycolic acid products that a lot of people use but they usually don't wash these off. It's really your choice so meh but I don't really like that aha. Just be warned AHA's will increase your skins photosensitivity, so please wear sunscreen every single day . You should be doing this anyway but if you don't, especially start to with AHAs. This is also why you use them at night. Hope this was helpful anon! could you wear a lil bronzer? Eep!"

Switch to chemical exfoliation, AHAs to brighten skin and remove acne scars etc and BHAs to clear acne from the skin. Obviously use sunscreen when doing this too. What facewash do you use? And what do you use to take your makeup off? Micellar water is the best way IMO to remove makeup, AND cleanse the skin, although I do use a gentle wash in the evening too after removing makeup. Do you use any moisturiser? It may seem weird adding more moisture to oily skin but if you're not getting enough hydration on the surface of the skin, whilst aggressively exfoliating, your skin is gonna be like ARGH and producing more oil. To reset basically, you need to change your routine and stick it out for a month or two for things to start turning themselves around. When adding a new product, only add one new thing at a time, so you can check if your skin reacts badly to it (you may get small spots but this is your skin \"purging\" usually. Anything else is usually a sign of irritation, although light tingling when using chemical exf. is okay (not like BURNING though lol)). Also use sunscreen, all of you. Thanks."

I'm too scared of chemicals and health risks and I don't trust people and ads enough to put any products on my genitals, though, so it'll probably stay a \"yeah that'd be nice but no thanks\" until something that really seems safe comes along. I \"bleached\" my nipples recently with my regular facial \"bleaching\" cream (anti-hyperpigmentation is the right name I believe) and got good results. They used to be a pretty pink until a few years ago, and I already put moisturizer on them regularly anyway (while moisturizing my boobs) so I figured it would be safe. It worked, they're a cute powder pink now, lighter than they used to be even. No rash, no dryness, no redness, no sensitivity, nothing. Crotch area probably wouldn't make such a huge difference because I don't see it as often, but seeing my cuter nipples every time I take my clothes off really helped with my self esteem."

It was some truly miraculous stuff, I can look for the product name next time I'm home if you guys are interested. It completely removed my facial \"emo tan\" (forehead light colored because of bangs, rest of the face slightly tanned) as well. I'd bathe in the stuff daily if it wasn't so expensive.

This past October I did a 180 in my skin care routine and started focussing on hydration instead of surface exfoliation. I also cut the habit of touching my face and change my bedsheets as often as possible now. I've seen great results so far and I feel much more confident, I'm still sensitive to breaking out from time to time on my cheeks and chin though. I think it's from unwanted oil and debris getting caught in my pores from sharing the bed with my partner, and hormonal acne from my period. But thankfully it's easier to monitor and control now that my regiment is all about hydrating the skin, treating it as gently as possible, instead of applying friction and drying it out. African black soap, rose water, witch hazel and tamanu oil have become my choice favorites. I occasionally use the radiance tonic by Lancôme for some very light chemical exfoliation."

It might be dependent on if they are following new products a lot or stick to what works, or use both on different occasions (oil/balm for heavier makeup, micellar for light first cleanse). It seems like overall the market is very cleanser-saturated, so I'm wondering if there will be a \"new\" (not new, but trending, because all of these types have existed before, but the range and variety available was smaller) type emerging in the future."

For reference my skin in combo-oily but becoming more normal as I age and moisturize properly, and I am not sensitive to alcohol in my sunscreens. Pic related from left to right: SkinAqua Sarafit Essence - I like this one alright. It's a watery cream gel type texture and feels nice, but gives me more of a dewy finish than I would like. What is nice is that for the price, the bottle size is relatively bigger compared to other Japanese sunscreens. Biore UV Aqua Rich Essence - Even though the Asian Beauty world cried that this new formulation doesn't live up the to 2015 one, I still wanted to try it for myself. It feels thicker than the previous formula, but works fine? Compared to the SkinAqua, it's more gel-like and less watery. Biore Perfect Milk - White with runny (milky) texture. Good for makeup days because it's a little powdery in finish and priming. It's too drying to use atm during the winter though so I'm just holding onto it until it gets warmer to use."

I have these constant dark hollows under my eyes and my nasolabial folds have become more pronounced. I'm twenty-six so I know that my skin might not bounce back as well, but my sister offered to get me some products from Sephora as a late Christmas present and I didn't want to waste an opportunity to get something that actually works. Acne isn't a problem as long as I'm not on my period but the lines in my face really bother me. My skin is sensitive but not really either dry or oily unless I've been drinking."

Consistently taking care of your skin is better in the long run than hoping for a miracle product. Not sure if you want to look for any of those steps from Sephora though since staple products are things you use regularly and will need to replace so starting with lower-end stuff unless you have the budget for it is perhaps better. Maybe an extra boost step like an essence or serum (since it sounds like your skin is lacking in hydration or plumpness that causes visible lines) would be worth the treat, but I wouldn't recommend adding a bunch of things to your face without a solid routine to start with."

However, I was so used to the feeling of constant wetness I'd put on as much as possible so my skin looked crazy (at home). I don't get acne, just some occasional boils on my chin area that are probably hormonal related. My current routine looks like this: Eucerin Advanced Repair Cream at night Regular lotion during the day (I know, I should use facial lotion, but idk, I have never had a bad experience with regular so far) Sunscreen every day Remove makeup using garnier makeup wipes dupe What should I change in my routine?

I think I have the 0,5%, I'll check later. Anyway, the bezoyl peroxide is the trickiest one imho, because your skin starts to peel off and it itches a lot, but you can't scratch it (I did it once and it looked like I had burnt myself for a while). I was supposed to take isotretinoin as well, but those gels are working so well so far that I really think I will drop it.

If you haven't tried it in a while, think what you should do is: getting a bigger % (like the 8 or 10, preferrably 8 cause it's less abrasive. Or if you used the 2,5%, getting the 5%) and combining it with the tretinoin gel. Also, I know this is kinda obvious, but anyway, only apply it on the skin where the pimples are (for me, it's about 70% my face anyway lmao). The tretinoin gel is an acid, and it makes your skin thinner, so after a while, I believe the BP is going to be no longer needed. I also struggle with acne since I am 12 lol PCOS sucks, but I am living. If you can, please try this for at least 6 weeks before going through the meds. If you want it, I can post my whole routine! >kills me everytime i see girls who just splash their face with water and don't have to struggle with pimples, hope i'll be able to get close to that one day Word.

I have very dry skin so it helps. Currently I'm using: - Perricone MD vit c (shit is NOT cheap and not that good, will not repurchase) - OBAGI retinol 1% which is also expensive but my skin likes it - Exfolikate which is medicore, too expensive, will not repurchase - Estee Lauder ANR which makes my skin look fucking shit and I'm mad because it was like $150 so I'm just using it on my arms and shit -Perricone MD night cream which was like $300 but my skin really likes it lol -sheet masks I used to use a lot of K/J-beauty but never really stuck with them besides the hada labo face wash. i think western stuff just works better for me personally, but i have taken the concept of layering many different products, so there's that."

I took quite a low dose in the end, 20mg/day for 3 months. It was a few weeks before I say any noticeable positive change, so be warned - there can be a \"purging\" period while deeper comedonal and inflammatory lesions are forced out. Stick with it if this happens as things do improve vastly from there on out. Isotretinoin is the ONLY treatment that profoundly regulates sebum production and composition and normalises follicle activity - most of the time, the benefits persist well beyond the end of the treatment course. I personally suffered with dry lips and angular cheilitis but my skin was absolutely flawless for the most part and I'd do it again in a heartbeat if I had to. Nowadays nearly 10 years later, I do still have oily skin in general and pre-menstrual acne flares, but far milder than in the past."

I've had these purplish red marks under my chest must be lines from working out and on my sides on and off since I was a girl (pic related is where they are), but thought nothing of it since they would be there one day and go away the next depending on how I've been sitting.

Before I just told myself it's from sitting down for a long time and it'll go away by tomorrow but now it always looks like I've got sagging skin under my breasts even though I don't, it's just that line/wrinkle. I've only recently figured out I've got dry skin, if that helps. Are these stretch marks? Will they go away? Can I make them go away? They make me look like a granny."

I already use 0.25 tretinoin and 4% hydroquinone but it's a better alternative since it contains 12% - 8% hydroquinone, kojic acid, tretinoin, hydrocortison along with other helpful ingredients all concocted into one. Groot forumla #3 is significantly cheaper as well only costing 50 dollars, the downside is that it's meant to be used only for a single month however given the high dosage of hydroquinone that's understandable. I currently use biore watery essence 50 spf as a sunscreen but apparently it doesn't protect against UV-A rays which are responsible for tanning and melanin product, it only works against UV-B rays. So I'll be looking into getting a new sunscreen that counteracts this."

Maybe look into that if your breaking out is \"still significant\" after peroxide. I always stuck with benzoyl peroxide gel during my teen acne, but it just fed the fungus and made it worse. As for bacne help, it may be worth it to either change conditioner/shampoo or just wash hair in a way that doesn't touch your back. I also ignored this one for years because I love milk, but giving it up reduced the bacne dramatically. Even if I just eat some cheese I get a back cyst. So maybe give that a try! No experience with scar removal yet since I'm still fighting the good fight (and winning thank goodness). I hear lasers are best for keloids though."

I've bought a salicylic acid solution before but it didn't help me so I'm sticking to aspirin. It also helps fade scars faster. Although I have to admit I still get a few spots if I don't exercise but they don't hurt half as much and they go away in a couple of days. I don't use any other products, just the plain old nivea cream. I don't even wash my face anymore with face cleanser/soap/whatever it's called, just water. Pic related is my forehead right now and from last year. The texture of the skin is still a bit wonky but I have bangs anyway"

I have acne-prone, dry, dehydrated, and sensitive skin, sure but before I thought I just needed to ~take care of it.~ note: I'm nonwhite/mixed and my friend is lilywhite and older than me and never has used sunscreen. Me? I have used hats and sunscreen since I was 13. So the \"white people age worse\" thing doesn't apply here."

Meanwhile, I’ve been on accutane 2x, don’t eat dairy, wash my face twice a day, use acne treatments, moisturize, wear sunscreen, and am on Spiro and BC because my acne is so severe. Some people just won the genetic lottery. That’s why I hate normies who have perfect skin and just say shit like “just drink lots of water!!11!” or “just wash your face nasty.” Like oh my god I have tried everything and I still get deep painful cysts every day."

It sounds counter-intuitive, but make sure you moisturize properly afterwards. Sometimes your skin is so dehydrated it produces sebum in excess, and that's why you get so oily. Plus sebaceous filaments are way less visible when your skin is plump and hydrated. Also, oil cleansing has worked well for me. I don't even wear makeup but I use the Banila Co balm cleanser every other day and my sebaceous filaments look better now. I can even feel and see little \"plugs\" of sebum come out when I rub it in sometimes."

I found a probiotic and a kefir that's pretty cheap that has most of the best skin benefits. My gut health has been a lot better and it's been over a week since I got my last pimple (I get all around my mouth, jaw, and chin). I don't know if it's because I simplified my skincare or that.

I have always had horrible GI health since I was a baby. red/orange veggies also will help your skin just look better. exercise SUPPOSEDLY helps too.

It first happened in August of this year and I've noticed it every time I'm outside in cold weather since. The only thing I can think of that has changed is that I started doing skincare in early 2021, after never having done it before. I started moisturizing in the morning and at night, and using SPF daily. Around July I started using an over-the-counter retinol that irritates me sometimes. Could starting a skincare routine make my skin more sensitive and cause me to start getting these rashes?"

And I go days without putting anything on my face, yet I still break out. Tretinoin? I tried for probably 6 months and I ended up chickening out because I heard some stories about it negatively affecting the skin. I don't want to go on some sort of pill to fix my acne but I look so genuinely disgusting that I'm now genuinely getting afraid. The only thing keeping me comfortable is that now I have an excuse to literally ONLY wear a mask around other people and never take it off."

If I go outside, which is rarely, then I use a Korean sunscreen. I’m 30 now and I still don’t have any wrinkles, so it must be working. I attribute this to wearing sunscreen daily since I was 14 (and my koreaboo phase and interest in Korean skincare began, some idol I liked mentioned he liked girls with pale skin so I pathetically would try to keep my skin as pale as I could with sunblock in case I ever ‘met’ him kek. In hindsight this was actually smart because I was practicing skin protection even by 14. Back then I was obsessed and bought a massive bunch of Korean skincare. I realized most of the products were kind of meh and I only really liked 3-4 of them by the end of it, so I kept rebuying those. Now I find I don’t need more than 2 products a day. I still like to buy random Japanese products for their cute packaging but their performance is usually meh. I really liked pic rel and used it daily for 3 months. It didn’t have any lasting effects or improve my skins condition overall, but it was great as an oil free daily hydrator."
