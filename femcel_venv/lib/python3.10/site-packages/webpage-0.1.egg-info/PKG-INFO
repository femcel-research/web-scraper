Webpage is a Python module that offers an easy, fast, object-oriented
way of fetching the contents of a web resource, using common HTTP web
services. It handles etags, last-modified dates, HTTP GET and POST,
temporary and permanent redirects, and Not Found errors.

All behind the scenes, as the programmer only has to worry about instantiating
the "Webpage" class by providing a URL, calling the "post" and/or the "get"
method if he wants, and then calling the "download" method that returns
the contents of the page.

The programmer doesn't need to care about the page being moved, temporarily
or permanently, or even whether the contents of the page have not changed
since his last download, so they were not downloaded again for the sake of
speed. The "download" method of "Webpage" always and reliably returns what the
programmer needs: the actual contents.
