      "post content": "This was circa 2020, in the throes of corona virus when there was lots of places closed and restrictions on crowds etc. Bf and I got take away food, I baked some slices and we drove to the mountains bordering my city and spent a couple of hours stargazing/teaching ourselves how to take long exposure pics of the Milky Way whilst we had a picnic. He has a Ute so we lay down in the back and watch a few comets go by. Honestly one of the best nights of my life."
