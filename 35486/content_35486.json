      "post content": "Kodocha is visually amazing, with a stellar dub and a female protag that actually acts somewhat like a real kid. She's a cartoon character through and through, but the show is years more grounded and entertaining than any other anime (or frankly, media in general) I've seen that focuses on children. Very very good for a shoujo comedy."

It's really gorgeous though kinda \"stiff\" looking though I'm not complaining cause I enjoy that aspect too. If you like the European school setting, I think you  will like the style because it goes for that despite being set in Japan. Nothing too deep to say since my watches are so far apart, but it's good if you like interpersonal drama. I love how it makes highschool feel so highstakes lol. I think the setting before cellphones and internet makes me enjoy the drama more. It makes your personal life more important because you can't escape to the net. Highschool was really uneventful for me because I was always on the damn computer, and my phone.  I love Mariko's intense over the top feelings, it might feel kinda unrealistic but to me she feels like a genuinely mentally unwell person with attachment issues loll. Love it. So many good female characters to choose from for a favorite."
