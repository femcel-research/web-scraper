Reduce the volume on your headphones if possible and wear earplugs at loud events. Don't sabotage yourself like I did ;___;

I've also just now started to shave regularly but I still struggle with the "down there" part but i'll always be too ashamed to ask for advice because i'm way too old to not know this kind of stuff. I also have lots of hairs coming out from around my nipples and i wonder if i might have hormonal problems too. God i hate my life

Anonymous 09/28/21 (Tue) 11:43:38 AM65884 EoE_-_Asuka_pissed… My dad is a pretty cool guy. He won the custody battle for me which is an amazing feat in this country. But I overheard him say one tiny thing that ruined my perception of him forever.I was about 13 or 14. My dad was bathing my little brother (a toddler at the time) in the tub. At this time I was a nerdy, unpopular KHV that was horrified of human touch considering my mom beat me. And I hear this fucking worthless scrote explain to my toddler brother that I'm a whore. Where did that come from?I knew I wasn't hearing things, because as kids do, my brother yells "ANONETTE ISN'T A WHORE!" clear as day, and starts giggling.Am I overreacting? Is this a good enough reason to hate your dad forever? It hurts more down the line knowing my parents couldn't protect me from the later sexual abuse I encountered.
Anonymous 09/28/21 (Tue) 11:48:42 AM65885>>65884Pt. 2 to this confession? Or a different confession altogether.I look for fathers in other older men, and sometimes I fuck up and start developing crushes on those men. The particular teacher crush I have right now is the worst (best?) I've had. I love this guy, and part of me wishes I could open up to him and tell him everything. Hell, I wish I was married to him. But I wonder, if I were to tell all this to an older man with daughters, what he would think of my dad? Would he laugh and say "fathers are just like that"? Would he be disgusted on my behalf? Would he comfort me? I'm so pathetic.

Anonymous 09/28/21 (Tue) 03:20:58 PM65892>>65884Sounds like a giant misunderstanding that you let fester. I'm willing to bet every dollar I ever make that there's a reasonable explanation to this. You won't get that because if you bring it up with your dad he'll say "wtf are you talking about" because he legitimately has no idea what you're talking about because the context and what was actually said was forgotten. Raising kids is hard, he clearly loves you if he was willing to raise you by himself.

I feel frusterated, that i feel stuck compared to everyone else, and that I am struggling to push myself to new heights. And I hate it even more because I love it too much to give it up. I hate having this need to draw everyday, I hate how I have to neglect my drawings in order to pass a class, I hate how I cant stop thinking about it 24/7 because I just love it so much. It is my driving force in life, and right now it is giving me pain, but I will never give up on it. I know I am bad but I wont use that as an excuse to never get better. You will see.
Anonymous 09/28/21 (Tue) 06:24:06 PM65905>>65904>I am not good as I should be at my ageHave you actually specified what it is you should be capable of, or are you just looking at other artists polished works and beating yourself over the head for not being able to do so? The first is useful, the second is retarded.
Anonymous 09/28/21 (Tue) 06:26:11 PM65906>>65897Annoying asshole parents are annoying asshole parents, but even the most deranged lunatic abusive ones have internal logic. If you're literally a virgin (and posting here I am going to assume you didn't date either), then I really doubt even the most horrid of parents would call you a whore out of nowhere. Not saying it's justified, not saying it would be okay if it was justified, I am simply perplexed as to why your Father who fought so hard to take care of you would say such a thing.

If you ever feel like a huge pile of shit remember Van Gogh didn't start training until 27 and nobody can shut the fuck up about him. What matters is if your product is good eventually, any timeline analysis is just wankers trying to justify why things happened the way they did.

Or are you assuming he does because of what you heard when you were 13-14? Because honestly I'm on the same boat as >>65892 and think it's a big misunderstanding, and through the years you've thought too much about it. Like what's the logic behind him calling you a whore to your toddler sibling? My headcanon is your toddler brother heard the word and asked your dad what it was and he joked that you were one? Idk, sounds wacky that your father both loves you and fought to raise you despite your abusive mother and would do something like this, unless it was a dumb joke on his part.
Anonymous 09/28/21 (Tue) 11:38:33 PM65925>>65923>>65924Dad called me a whore once, mom has called me a whore repeatedly since then, and it really seems like they sometimes get together and gossip about my supposed whore-dom and it just pisses me off.Sorry for the vagueness. It most certainly wasn't my little brother asking what a whore was because I KNOW I heard my dad pathetically venting to my brother all those years ago.

What anime and self-loathing does to a mf. It's kind of entertaining to see her every class, though. Like a sideshow distraction. Her face makes things a little less boring, I'll miss it when this class is over. I guess she's cute or whatever, I don't know.

Anonymous 10/01/21 (Fri) 02:38:39 AM66046Is it weird that I really despise yuri, as a lesbian? Because when I look at the yuri character who has balloon tits/butt, or is underage, or jokingly gropes the other woman, or does the cunnilingus the wrong way, or looks at the viewer, and plenty of other small stuff…it gives me a feeling that the drawer doesn’t see the yuri characters as human. Doesn’t see lesbians as human. Idk, a chilling ”awakening” that I cannot un-realize once I notice it. Can’t shake the feeling that I’m looking at the same stuff all the deranged misogynists and delusional troons are feeding themselves from. That all the evil that seeks to harm people like me is sourced from this stuff, and that I should feel bad for enjoying it. Even the cutesy innocent stuff gives me the feeling that it’s only drawn so that the innocence could be tarnished or idealized. >inbf they’re just picsI know I’m overthinking it, and I wish to know how to stop.
Anonymous 10/01/21 (Fri) 10:23:54 AM66059>>66046The vast majority of yuri/GL really is like that becuase it is indeed made by moids. I liked the little GL I managed to find that was actually made by women. It's yaoi/BL that I personally don't get the appeal of at all. I get that it makes moids seethe, but I'm still not interested in watching men fucking each other. I know that many interpret yaoi boys as butch women but I'm neither butch nor really into butches myself so it still doesn't attract me. I wish more women made more quality GL.

I mean, she's too busy working right now so we can't even go on a walk together or anything. I don't have anyone else to message either. And the primary thing that upsets me still I that she didn't notify me. I feel like a burden now that doesn't do shit. I'm still going to get a job by the end of this year I'm pretty sure, but I feel like we'll just grow apart because she I think never bothered to message me about anything for almost the entirety of september.I don't want this to happen, since we've been friends for almost 8 years now and I have no one else to share my life with and vent to and neither does she. I'm still worried about getting a job because I have to care for my cat, but I'll hope I'll be able to find one that has a decent schedule. Though most jobs that have my desired requirements (which are: i don't have to interact with customers and it's not 1 hour+ away from my home) are 10+ hours.

Anonymous 10/02/21 (Sat) 03:51:30 AM66087>>66046Yuri is not supposed to be a representation of real lesbians, but rather the opposite. Just like anime in general is not supposed to be a representation of real life or real human interactions. You're just expecting it to be something it's not.
Anonymous 10/02/21 (Sat) 02:28:55 PM66125>>66046Huge yurifag dyke here. Sounds like you just don't like animu or Jap writting style in general, maybe try Korean shit? Anyway, contrary to popular belief, most yuri is actually made by women, including the lots of the moe subtext ones you find in the Kirara/Cune magazines. Porn yuri is the one mostly done by males but you can clock them because of their artstyle, like you said balloon tits and some other gross shit. But once you know which artists are female and dedicated creators you won't have to touch moid yuri ever again. That said I do like Kurogane Ken/Kishi/Takashi Ikeda because they are not incels and it shows, even if they are moids they can pull off very good yuri romance and eroticism, but only those 3. All other moid artists suck.>>66059I also advice you to try the Korean shit instead. All the lesbians I see complaining about Jap yuri end up loving the Korean/Chinese manwha. If you need recs for female-made Jap yuri I can help though.>>66087Also this. Yuri ruined me because I got heavy into it before real relationships and now real shit is not appealing to me anymore. Reality and yuri are not compatible.

Assume all artists are female unless stated otherwise btw.>chineseIn my opinion these are the worst, but some people really like them. They mostly do schoolgirl shit that barely goes beyond subtext, maybe because of harsh anti-homo laws.>Their StoryReally slow updates, I think author is already in a gov watchlist because she also does yaoi and got told to stop once.>Green tea bitchHaven't read it but a lot of people are loving it. Artist sex unknown to me.>koreanLike 90% of these are erotic telenovelas done by female artists. Almost no schoolgirl shit. In my opinion they are either so bad it's good or actually decent stuff.>Her Shim CheongHistorical, not erotic, probably my favorite manwha. Explicitly discusses misogyny in the era its set in. Not sure about the sex of the authors (they are a pair), I think they also do yaoi so probably female but have male avatars thus the confusion.>Moonlight GardenHistorical, erotic, weird female for female prostitution setting but it's cute. Good read if you're horny I guess.>White Angels Have No WingsModern era, schoolgirl shit, slightly erotic. People into BDSM and bullies love this shit because it touches those themes. Personally I didn't like it very much.>White Angels Have No RestContinuation of above but they are no longer schoolgirls, it became almost 100% porn. Didn't read past the first chapters because I hate the MCs.>WDTFSI think this one was the very first one that started it all. It's a fucking telenovela through and through. Very erotic. I think it's ok but it still got a gorillion fans who absolutely love this series. Recently it got a drama CD.>Relationship GuidelinesSlow schoolgirl shit but I like it, characters don't look like kids. Not lewd. Just check it out.>LilithBDSM heavy shit, I don't like it but a lot of people do.>PulseActually not Korean, artist is thai or some shit. Anyway, it's a good porny series.>JapaneseI'm probably biased towards JP shit because I'm a weeb so this will be a long list. JP stuff is usually schoolgirl shit but as of recently more and more series about adults are coming out.>Girl FriendsThe yuri classic by Morinaga Milk (do check out her other stuff). It's sweet schoolgirl shit, very slow to develop at the beginning but it gets better. Lots of stupid drama as well.>OctaveYou either love it or hate it. Adult setting, slightly erotic. Setsuko is a saint.>CitrusYou've probably heard of this. It sucks. It's a telenovela but with retarded schoolgirls. I hate it. If you like Citrus consider suicide. Still putting it here because millions of people worldwide love the shit out of it so maybe it could also be your thing.>Yagate Kimi ni NaruAlso probably have heard of it, insanely popular in the past few years. It was ok, definitely felt different from other schoolgirl shit but I don't think it's too special. Sayaka is best girl and if you like her please do read her novels after completing the manga. Actually her novels are what I would recommend the shit out of this series.>Kase-sanTomboy yuri great. Fluffy and cute.>Handsome Girl and Sheltered Girl5/5 bretty gud I even bought it in Japanese. College setting. It's silly but also has good romance. Short 2 volume manga definitely a recommended read. Artist is most likely female, authors (Mochi) are a het pair I think.>Koushin Koinu Ni Koibumi WoOne of my personal favorites because I'm a militaryfag. Historical, probably set in the Meiji era since there are references to the Russo-Japanese war. It's actually schoolgirl shit but set in a military academy for girls. It's just a cute love story, nothing more to it but art is very good and Tamasaki Tama definitely knows her military shit of the time, so the setting feels very authentic.>Asumi-chan Is Interested in Lesbian Brothels!One of my favorite ongoing manga. It's lewd as the title suggests but bretty gud. It actually sparked a current trend of lesbian prostitution series for some reason. Author is female, if you have doubts about it.>The two of them are pretty much like thisAdult setting. Short chapters. Cute series with an already established couple. Author is Ikeda Takashi, also did Sasameki Koto which in my opinion is not that good but this is. Moid btw.>The Ends of a DreamAlmost completely translated, 2 volumes. Incredibly depressing story of two women who lived through WWII and the eras after it. It's recounted in reverse chronological order from when they are old ladies to when they are girls. Cannot recommend it enough.>Aoi HanaAnother yuri classic, author does all sort of LGBT stories. For most of the story it's schoolgirl shit but still good, introspective kinda stuff. It also got a very nice looking anime by JC Staff back then in 2009.>Still SickAbout a yurifag who doesn't let herself love real women. Adult setting. I think it's cute, funny and good. Some drama here and there too.>Tsurezure BiyoriDiabeetus-inducing schoolgirl shit. It's short, like 2 or 3 volumes total. Nothing special but again, very sweet and innocent. Author might be a moid but who knows.>Hana ni ArashiIt's like a contemporary Girl Friends but done right. Also sweet, cute and fluffy.>Hello, Melancholic!MC is like a non-furry female Legoshi. I like the side couple way more but overall still enjoyable.>So, Do You Want To Go Out, Or?Long running series getting officially translated I think. College setting but non-conventional love story, if you can even call it that. Basically the plot is that the two MCs only go out with each other because they are the only lesbians they know, not because they actually love each other, thus shit eventually goes down.>Hayate X BladeSo this one is actually a battle shounen but gay as fuck. It's very old now and finished so no one really talks about it anymore but when I was a baby weeb there were threads about it in /u/. The first series had like 18 volumes and the second one another bunch. Still getting translated but I'm sure YP will be done within 10 years, hopefully. Very funny btw.And finally I recommend the following authors in general, who have done several good series/doujins so you might as well check out all their stuff.>Morishima Akiko>Amano Shuninta>Takemija Jin>Morinaga Milk>Yuni>Ooshima Tomo/Ooshima Towa>Negom>Nekomura>Hiiragi Yutaka>Kuwabara>Itou Hachi (oneloli warning)>Momono Moto>Neji>Yukiko>Sato>Oosawa Yayoi>Mikanuji>Tamamusi>Kishi Torajirou (moid)>Kurogane Ken (moid)>Nagori Yu>Codeyamada>Iruma Hitoma (moid)>Nishi Uko>Hayashiya ShizuruAnd I cannot think of more at the moment. If you're also willing to play VNs I really recommend the FLOWERS series, they are kinda like Marimite but gayer and the subject of homosexuality is actually touched. Writer is female. Great OST. They are for sale on Steam and the translation for the last game of the series will probably be finished by next year. Also recommend A Summer's End, it's set in the 80's in Hong Kong, devs are Asian-Americans or some shit, artist is Lilaccu who is a JP les living in Canada I think. Anyway, this is actually a lesbian VN.

He's hot and charming and a good bit older than me which has always been a kink I was too worried to try out irl. He's also married.Now I knew that going in and asked him as soon as things got sexual if his wife knows about his reddit and that he flirts with girls. He said yes but she doesn't want to know specifics. Alright cool, I like to take people by their word until proven otherwise. But then I recently went through his reddit comment history and he said, months and months back, that online stuff doesn't "feel like cheating". So I am worried he is doing this behind his wives back.Idk how to confront him about that. A selfish part of me doesn't want to at all since I am riding the high of the early relationship hard and I don't wanna lose that. I really really like him. But the thought of being the other woman and helping a guy cheat on his wife grosses me out, even if it's just sexting.>>64001Pretty sure the rule is 3 minutes.

I don't like Adashima that much because it's slow as shit, but I liked what he did with the Sayacuck novels. It's not that I hate moid authors or have something against them, it's just that most of them don't fit my taste.And speaking of LNs I started reading both the "Completely Falling Within 100 Days" one and also "There's No Way I Can Have A Lover" by the same author, which are also nice and can check them out if you're bored. Both also have ongoing manga adaptations but I think the scanlation groups stopped them, one because it's hard for them and the other because of NTR autism. Anyway, the novels are still being translated as far as I know.Also not exactly weeb but the Kiyoshi novels from Avatar have yuri and they are nice overall if you like that series.

Sunday makes the two year anniversary of dropping out of my first semester of college due to worsening mental health. I lost most of my friends due to various circumstances. I can feel myself losing grip on reality more as time goes by. I have so much more trouble relating to people now. I tend to envision myself as an observer "behind the glass", watching the world from a safe distance, observing the patterns and habits and peculiarities of the people around me but never getting close. At times it's hard almost to even conceptualize myself as a human being. The other night I went for a walk and the wind began to pickup, and I just stood there like a retard with the wind blowing in my face because it felt like my molecules were being scattered and passed through the wind. I have been thinking about a brief relationship nonstop for longer than the relationship itself even lasted. I should be worried, but its hard to even care. I guess that I care to some degree, or else I wouldn't be posting.

Anonymous 01/21/22 (Fri) 06:16:46 AM72365 1629595835793.jpg >>64811I hate being asexual and sex repulsed. I'm afraid no one will love me because of it.  I had a crush on a guy I met at work over the Summer. We had a lot in common but than I thought "oh, he'll probably want to have to sex with me." So, from then on, I pretty much avoided him until I quit. Part of me wants to desensitize myself to sex so I can at least mentally prepare myself for when it does happen but part of me thinks it's disturbing that I have to pretty much live a lie to keep a relationship going.

She and I talked a lot, a couple of times on WhatsApp video calls. So she certainly was real.  Few months ago, I was ghosted, not long after she told me that she’s feeling sick with covid sympoms. I sent her a message once in a while, asking if she’s okay. Yesterday, I went to work, and a subject that we often talked about came up. Even worse, it was by a woman with the same first name as her. Well, I started crying. I have never cried after online friends before. Never. But now, just happened. Probably because I had also spent the past night wondering if she’s even alive. I was a fucking fountain of tears. It was so embarrassing. I miss her.
Anonymous 04/06/22 (Wed) 11:14:48 PM75675 Spoiler >>75504I completely understand your attraction. What I don't understand is how you could do a lot of research on him and consider him one of the worst people ever, superficially on the basis of number of people killed, without looking at intention. His rant videos clearly explain his gripes and provide clarity that he was acting under the belief that death was the only way to save people. Had he, say, murdered people out of some sick perversion, or tortured his targets, or inflicted great harm upon them prior to death, I would understand calling him a bad noodle, but contrary to this he seemed to be aiming for a clear goal with the purpose of reducing overall suffering in the world, and took measures to ensure those he targeted died quickly and relatively painlessly. How can you judge him so harshly knowing this, worse yet, while claiming to like him? I don't think it's very cash money of you to slander someone you supposedly like.

You can be attracted to someone and not support or condone everything they've done. I think it was unbelievably selfish of him to do what he did. He should have just killed himself and left it at that. Ironic that he was all about how kids should have the ability to consent like mini adults but then he took away their basic human right to just exist. I'm sure in his head he did think he was "saving" them from the perils of having to grow up in civilization, but if he was so big on kids having the right to make their own decisions then shouldn't he have let them at least make their own choice as to whether they wanted exist in society or not? Instead he made the decision for them, which yeah, makes him a selfish and terrible person.

Anonymous 05/16/22 (Mon) 05:16:05 PM77445I’m considering making a few upvote bots on Reddit, not because I want karma, but because I need karma to get into the spesific subreddits I want to post in.I have talked about my sensitive issues on that account, so it wouldn’t be safe to try to get the upvotes from scrote-infested popular subs without the karma limit, and the ones I’m posting in never have any visitors, and they’re rather rude and clique-y too.Been browsing on those subs for 2 months trying to raise the karma to the acceptable limit, and it’s frustrating as hell.

I don't want everything I post about linked together but their system tries hard to discourage multiple accounts by making you need to have minimum karma to post anywhere. I don't want to waste time making tons of pointless posts on each account so I can finally post the one heartfelt post I want to.Plus redditors suck as people. All the people I know IRL who post on reddit are awful.
Anonymous 05/17/22 (Tue) 11:30:30 PM77521>>77480>Plus redditors suck as people. All the people I know IRL who post on reddit are awful.100% agree. I've met a few people irl who regularly used reddit and they all came off as pretentious assholes. They were almost like reddit was a part of their personality. Being younger and stupid, I tried my best to make friends with these people but they shut me out.I say this about social media in general, and reddit is one of the worst, it just oozes this disgusting negativity and narcissism that shapes peoples  mindset in the worst ways. And first time I've heard of that, private reddits you have to make so many circlejerk posts before you're allowed in the club, thats just laughable. Call it conspiracy if you will but it seems to me there is some sort of mind programming happening with those sites. I notice a distinct personality difference between people who use social media little to none and spend most of their time on other things, versus people who spend most of their time mindlessly scrolling social media.I guess this is my confession but these past few years my husband has been obsessively browsing reddit, to the point I feel like it's getting in the way of our relationship. tbh I'm a little jealous, I wish I were able to get his attention like that. Prob made this obvious but I don't use any social media at all, I mean it's ok with me if someone does, I just don't care for people who make it a significant part of their lifestyle. But this is like an unhealthy compulsion, he spends hours on reddit, it's the first thing he does when he wakes up, comes home, anytime he gets a free moment with his hands he's instantly jumping on reddit. He gets so into it he will sometimes not respond when I talk or says he just wants to be alone so he can do reddit. He rarely seems to go on any other site. I have a hard time even watching shows with him, half the time he'll pull out his phone and if I ask him if he can put it away he has difficulty paying attention and gets distracted a lot like his attention span is fried. I can also tell that some of the negative things he reads on there put him in a sour mood some days. He seems to go between looking at barely interesting clickbaity stuff and news fear mongering stuff. When I can actually get him away from reddit doing something else for a few hours he starts acting more normal. This is all very concerning to me. When I try bringing it up to him he just says I'm overthinking it and I should let him do what he wants. I agree a person should be allowed to do what they want but just Idk what to think about this.
Anonymous 05/18/22 (Wed) 12:06:49 AM77524>>77521Could he have ADHD?If not, you need to be strict and force him to put it away. Turn off the show if he takes his phone out.
Anonymous 05/18/22 (Wed) 06:56:22 AM77535>>77524Don't know but I've considered it a possibility. Many days, for some reason reddit is the only thing he's willing to do for hours at a time. Even then he can't seem to sit still. With other activities he frequently gets distracted, tends to not pay close attention and fidgets and gets up often. He can't even seem to pay attention to a conversation half the time. I've known him a long time and this behavior has definitely gotten worse in just the past few years. While I want to blame the reddit obsession as the likely cause, who knows what it really could be. I don't like trying to tell him what to do, he can waste his time how he wants, but I do feel annoyed at times.

But I dont know how I would handle a relationship especially from the sexual aspect, since the thought of having piv sex makes me feel deeply uncomfortable.

Have you considered you're just sexually repressed and that is why your libido is so low, and why you're uncomfortable with piv, yet you also desire children and find men romantically attractive? I think you're missing the simplest explanation here, and that's why you're thinking something as absurd as you being a man deep inside.

Absolutely all the upsides and downsides.I don't really like this trans crap, but from a purely transhumanistic and body-mod standpoint, I think it's actually really good that you have so many options about controlling how you want your body to like. I see HRT (purely medical, unrelated to "trans identity") as a body-mod like anything else, such as boobjobs, BBL, lip fillers and whatever else you can think of. And I think there's nothing wrong if you want to take it for whatever reason, but I advise you to be informed and responsible about what it will do to your body.
Anonymous 06/09/22 (Thu) 05:08:15 PM79027>>79025Nona, are you me?I srs do not believe women are actually attracted to average males. How? Just how?? Short hair on men is just gross
Anonymous 06/09/22 (Thu) 08:48:34 PM79030>>79025me too, i like effeminate men (although i have not been blessed with the attraction to women) but most of them are gay or assholes. i just want a cute guy

Been in my head too long for it to just go away by itself too. 8-9/10 days it is something that I can ignore pretty well and be mostly content with being normal, but those 1-2 days feel really bad. You can only be a tomboy for so long (and I repress so hard that I am not even that lol) before your biology drags you back to where it wants you to be.>>79026I do not plan on it, aside for the fact T destroys your reproduction system once youre on it for like 2-3 years (which is a big problem for me as Ive said), it only does so much. Sure it changes the face, the shoulders and makes you hairier but thats it, the ftm timelines you see are like 30%T and 70% intense gym routine. It would not fix my height, or my wide ass hips. My face is quite androgynous and I can pass as a cute 15 year old even without T, but if I trooned out I'd just be a boyfaced manlet lol. Tbh the health risks aside for it nuking your uterus permanently are not that bad, but it's just there is more to being a man than having a stache and a longer midface and I can never have that, which breaks my heart sometimes.This also applies to other groups than just ftms, but you can really do whatever you like to your body and get away with it until you hit your late 20s, and by the time you are 30 your bad decisions will have caught up with you. I am not sacrificing up to 50+ years of my life to live as a guy for some 5-10 yearsdamn this ended up being an essay lol

Anonymous 06/10/22 (Fri) 12:43:54 AM79038>>79037Nona I was kind of a tomboy (never committed fully but more than halfway there) for most of my life up until like barely 2 years ago and I had to become more feminine for my own sanity. It felt good performing masculinity, but usually what it lead to is me being put down and reminded of the fact that I am not a man and never will be. Typical example:>Go to the gym with some male classmates>I work out a bit and feel happy doing something masculine>Look at how they are doing for a little>They can pull much heavier weights than I can>Much more muscle mass for about the same amount of exercise too>Realize that Ill have to try twice as hard to achieve what they get with a modest amount of effort>Sadwent on for almost all of my teenage years until I decided I couldn't bear it anymore. I'd rather act as an average woman which makes you kind of invisible than being reminded almost daily of my innate inadequacy.
Anonymous 06/10/22 (Fri) 01:08:07 AM79039>>79038Nona being gnc doesn’t mean you’re performing masculinity and competing with men. It doesn’t even mean being a tomboy. It simply means you’re not performing femininity ie putting on make up, acting in a way society deems acceptable for your gender, etc. i am gnc, i don’t go out of my way to act like a man, i’m just being myself and it happens to go against what people think a woman should be. Of course i’m not saying this is the standard, but it’s a choice for you if the societal idea of womanhood makes you uncomfortable. As for inadequacy, there are things men cannot do, that women can and vice versa. This doesn’t mean you’re inadequate. They are naturally stronger in the upper body, big deal nona they’re still retards. please don’t do this to your psyche

Anonymous 06/10/22 (Fri) 08:03:28 AM79047>>79030>>79027>>79025This is normal. I don't even believe that women like masculinity, I think they are intimidated and forced into liking it because men punish women who like cute guys, and punish the cute guys themselves. Still it is SO easy for them to be cute. Most men are actually really attractive and it doesn't take much effor they just go out of their way to kill their looks. We must revolt against this and have our own revolution because I'm sick of being numb.

Anonymous 06/11/22 (Sat) 05:57:36 AM79117>>79039Nta, but judging from this logic I'm also gnc even if I don't identify as such, I just rarely put effort into being feminine and thought of myself as being frumpy for this
Anonymous 06/11/22 (Sat) 10:06:47 AM79122>>79117it’s not about “identifying” if you don’t conform you don’t conform. if you don’t look and act feminine you will  be perceived aa gnc regardless.

Anonymous 08/09/22 (Tue) 06:30:09 AM83062>>83048There is a difference between noticing someone is attractive and indulging in that attraction. The way I see it, a "crush" is something more active than just noticing someone is attractive. It requires spending time thinking about them and fantasizing about them, it is definitely something voluntary and shitty to do when in a relationship.You both should cut it out or break up with your bf.

Anonymous 09/23/22 (Fri) 03:09:28 PM87375I'm actually considering baby trapping a man. My boyfriend committed suicide when our daughter was 2 and I've done my best with her on my own, but she struggles with school. She can't concentrate in class, keep up with work or make friends. I found a group run by parents and teachers who tested her and it turns out she's extremely gifted. I was given a lesson by one of the tutors, who turned out to be a pretty incredible guy finishing his undergrad. In a few weeks she tested out of her year and is now able to score highly with high school material. She still hates school, but is able to endure it because she's made friends from this group and absolutely adores him. Seeing her excited to learn and excel just leaves me elated, because she'll be able to graduate high school early and pursue her aspirations. A few months ago he finished his Masters and told me he was quitting to start his career, but I'd started sleeping with him and dating and he continued to work with her on homework and test material because he was around so often.In my defence, I'm not saying this is what I'll do, but we practically live together, he wants kids and he's naturally resistant to change. I'm ashamed to be even thinking about it, but I want to have another child before it's too late, he's young and handsome and it's so incredibly rare to find a man you can not only trust with children, but know they'll have a good relationship.

But thank you, I hope you are feeling okay too. Nearly a year later and I'm doing a lot better actually, far better than I ever could have imagined. Not necessarily great, but things have changed for me a lot and I care more about my own life. At the time of writing that post I was suffering from some sort of mental health issue that's still giving me trouble unfortunately. I still don't have friends really, but I'm employed in retail and talk to people on a daily basis. Sometimes I still don't feel real, but the feeling comes and goes a lot. Probably the craziest update I can give to this post is that the relationship I mentioned actually ended up working out and we're seeing each other again.

He knew how to BBQ and cook, garden, build/fix stuff (he made my grandma her own little cozy shed beside their house so she could have her alone time whenever), was really intelligent, and he was good with animals. He also had beautiful hands. He was seriously my type.I have yet to meet a guy my age who can come close to him. And if there are, I feel like there would be a catch. Like he'd murder/abuse me if I angered him, or he would leave me if I ever got sick because I won't be able to make his dick hard anymore. I know I'm weird for thinking like this of him but none of the men around me can even compete with him. At least I have my husbando, I guess.

Anonymous 01/09/23 (Mon) 05:10:50 AM94098Recently I've been daydreaming about falling in love with an older man who gives me advice and looks out for me. I imagine him to be a somewhat snarky, laidback guy who seems not to care but genuinely tries to look out for me. He doesn't help me out because he is attracted to me, but maybe because he can relate to feeling lost and alone at my age and wants to help. I'm not into age-gap stuff usually, but I assume it's because I'm at a really lonely and stressful point in my life right now and wish I had someone who I could depend on to look out for me. Obviously it's tough because I think it's a red flag when men are attracted to women much younger than them, but also in my fantasy he has to be an older guy for it to work since I wouldn't take guidance from a man who was close to my age kek. Anyway it's just a fantasy. In real life, men who are older don't seem that much more well-adjusted or dependable than men who are younger. They're only that way in books and movies and stuff like that.

Anonymous 02/14/23 (Tue) 03:22:16 PM95713i fucking hate conventially attractive people so much. it becomes so much more obvious on valentines day too. ive never received a genuine compliment on my appearance ever. ever since i was a child, i’ve been seen as ugly or unconvential looking. it’s become worse as i got older. people only compliment me out of pity. they come up with vague stuff that i know doesn’t apply to me. they focus on anything but my facial features. every bit of my appearance that i have altered so i can be accepted, is the only thing that is accepted. the thing it’s attached to (me), remains unaccepted. all of my friends have gotten confessed to, received valentines’ presents or whatsoever. meanwhile i can’t even believe this actually happens to people. it sounds like it only happens in movies or fiction. i’m fine being deemed unattractive. but people pitying me and pretending i’m not has fucking exhausted me into wanting to kms.

I am more interested in feeling vulnerable, compressed, and having my body being mainipulated and me being accepting of it. Theres a deep intimacy in allowing yourself and entrusting yourself to bondage and its def theruputic in my opinion. i really appreciate it as an art form as well, especially in the realm of sculpture since it feels visually visceral (especially if you have felt the ropes yourself) which can play alot into the visuals and meanings of the subject/peice. I hope that makes sense.

Anonymous 05/10/23 (Wed) 02:37:21 PM98718After years of introspection and shadow work, I think a subset of my actions are secretly motivated by my wanting to be desirable to men. I'm autistic and so have never really felt super "connected" to gender norms and social hierarchies on an intuitive level, and so in my teenage confusion-induced analysis outsourced my sense of feminine self to what I "studied" the boys around me to be interested in. I did not solely decide who I was to match this, but always had a core sense of self/interests, just without knowing how to "perform" as a woman in the larger scheme of things and so I learned to function in certain ways to seem desirable to the types of guys I would be interested in. It almost feels like being the most undetectable siren. Not to say I'm all that successful, but that I don't think I've ever been remotely considered a "pick me" type despite knowing internally I have this deep drive to sway the hearts of certain men, be extremely desirable, out-compete other women, etc. I see myself pity girls whose efforts are so obvious and don't work very well. But at the same time sympathize as a fellow woman tainted by a world catered to men. It's like I get a high imagining myself getting a man to fall head over heels for me. To be seen as largely more desirable than some of the women around me. Luckily I don't go into every place with this mindset and see every girl like competition, but those I do feel it with it's very intense. I've denied and suppressed this part of myself for years, but after being betrayed by my ex have developed a fixation on trying to never let that sort of thing happen again. Largely my desires in life are to be self sufficient and carry out the many projects and dreams I have completely separate from the male gaze, but there's this superficial nagging voice that demands I perfect and improve my appearance, demeanor, knowledge sets, body language, so I can cover the base of being a desirable woman. It ultimately disgusts me that I feel this way when I also feel so unimpressed and disturbed by men as a whole. But here I am admitting it to myself and here that this part of me exists in hopes of taming and understanding it.

Anonymous 08/09/23 (Wed) 02:02:56 AM102896I have been self hating my entire life for being a woman, idk when it started but I just knew there was something that made me not want to be a woman for as long as I remember. I also hate myself for being in moid spaces like chans in the past and never picked up on my self hating ways and how desensitized I was towards degeneracy and general moid shit until recently. Surprisingly my friends are all women probably because deep down what I truly hated was not actual women, but male behavior and degeneracy directed towards women which is probably why I had a hard time accepting the reality of being a woman to begin with and in denial of my biology.

Anonymous 08/29/23 (Tue) 04:25:47 PM103683 66D99615-3F92-4172… I am the secret child of an affair between my mother and my father who is married and has a big whole family that isn’t aware of my existence. My parents are still in a loving romantic relationship, although secret - I’ve been told that his wife suspects he has been seeing someone for a while but doesn’t ask. Things are this way because he’s the heir to a prominent family in our city, very religious and conservative, wealthy and connected, and he had too much to loose to just dump all this for my mom even though she’s his true love. My mom says she likes things as they are because she’s independent and wouldn’t want to live with him anyway. I’m not sure if it’s a cope or what but I’m not here to judge their relationship and I feel grateful to have parents who love each other. I had no relationship with him till I was around 8, although my mom always told me the truth about everything. Basically he didn’t want me initially and only accepted to see me around that time, although in a public setting which meant we had to pretend we didn’t know each other. It happened another time and I haven’t seen him since. We call each other regularly for a few minutes, I tell him about my studies and daily life, he tells me about his and his family life as if everything was normal. That’s just how things have always been for me and I mostly thought I didn’t suffer from it, because my mom is an exceptional parent that filled that gap and since he was never there in the first place I never felt like I missed him. I also had unrelated childhood trauma that overshadowed everything else. As an adult with psychological issues, I’m starting to do some introspection and wonder how it affected me (since it isn’t a normal or healthy setting). I also hope that someone here can read this and relate to me in some way since I’ve never met someone that did, and it’s a pretty lonely place to be in. Since I was a child I was aware of it and had to lie about it and cover for them, which I still have to do now since questions like‘what do your parents do?’ always come up at some point. I don’t want to lie anymore and say he’s dead or something, so I just say my parents don’t live together and I’m not close with him : everyone can tell that there’s something up but thankfully people understand that it’s uncomfortable and usually move on. In a weird way I grew to enjoy having a secret, which also made me very closed off to people. I had a really hard time telling my partner about it, it took years, and it definitely gave me trust issues and the need to always, always, keep some things secret and private. I can’t make my parents change their relationship but I definitely want to change mine with my father. I always said I don’t care about him and it’s true that I only stay in touch with him because my mother asks me to, and he helps us financially. I resent his cowardly nature  and the way he seems content with our current relationship, which is obviously very surface level and superficial. He should be the one to do it but I will ask him to meet in person soon. He’s getting older and I don’t want him to just die like that and leave me with regrets later on, even though right now I feel like I wouldn’t care much. Sometimes I wish his family knew about me, since mine is so small and his so big. Knowing I could be an aunt pains me, but it isn’t my family even though we’re blood related and look alike. If they’d knew about me, would they want to meet me ? On the other hand I would hate for the secret to be blown out in the open. I don’t want to be seen as an illegitimate children, and even more so I don’t want my mother to be seen as the mistress and carry that shame. Things feel unfair as they are, but I guess I wouldn’t want them any other way ? Once my mom told me that one day he might come clean, but only on his deathbed. As ironic as it is, he’s a devout Christian and I guess he might want to repent and be honest at some point, I just hope he keeps in mind how it would hurt us (and his family) and just bear his cross. I don’t know what I should tell him if I see him, but this might be something I should ask about. If I ask him to meet in person and he declines, I’ll cut ties with him. Even though I don’t think I suffer from it that much (although I’m currently looking into the psychological effects of having an absent father, and relate to some) it’s a burden to keep what is to me a fake relationship. I realized recently that I want to love him truly, as a daughter would, but I’m incapable of doing so as things are right now. I think he loves me sincerely, for what it’s worth, and I pity him as he reaches out to me, although always through the comfortable distance of a phone call and afraid of the resentment I might hold towards him. I also keep in mind that if I wasn’t successful, but a stereotypical problematic bastard child, he might have never wanted to do anything with me.
Anonymous 08/31/23 (Thu) 02:42:16 AM103717>>103683I'm fellow illegitimate spawn, and I have to warn you that you almost certainly will regret coming out to his family. If they're rich, conservative and religious, it will detonate their entrenched social hierarchy and you will absorb all the ill will they can't express to the person whose fault it actually is. The worst amongst them will make you into a punching bag and lay all blame at your feet. They may even pursue you in order to punish you for the crime of being born. I do think you need to meet him and resolve the nature of your relationship, but don't get your hopes up for genuine closure. He's a coward and he more than likely will string you along to avoid having to actually face the consequences of his actions. Whatever happens, I just hope you can resolve your feelings about this and grow from out of his shadow.

Usually because I am drunk and the person I’m dating being argumentative and unloving so I just want to feel something. The first time I did it I felt bad about it and told the scrote I was with and he forgave me. I haven’t really seen it as a major character flaw as I’m not sleeping with another person, though I feel kind of embarrassed about it and don’t want to come clean about it. I wonder if it’s normal

I just wonder at times how it would be like if it was out in the open, since my mom thinks that my father will want to reveal everything before dying even though we would rather not. Even if it happened I wouldn’t reach out to them, although I wouldn’t be opposed to meeting them if some of them wanted to. Thank you for your kind words anon, I hope your life also goes well despite those circumstances.

Anonymous 09/17/23 (Sun) 10:47:09 PM104148>>103683Is the financial support enough to have an actual comfortable life on your own? As far as I'm concerned he owes you all the years of having his cake and eat it too while you had a broken family for his convienience. And you should make him pay. You shouldn't be worried about the peace of mind or social stability of a rich adulterer, when he clearly has lived comfortably having you as this side thing on his life. Squeeze that shit. Don't live at the mercy of his kindness when he's been avoiding his responsibilities for years. Now, I don't mean storm his house with a lawsuit or nothing. But start making it clear to him that he's caused you a lot of grief and he should make things right by supporting you. But if money is not a problem to you and all you want is a relationship. I'm sad to tell you you're never gonna have it. He's clearly not someone concerned with doing what's right since he's been doing this for years. At most you're gonna get some awkward visits and phone calls. Even if he did decide to introduce you to his family you're just gonna be this weird thing that sticks out at every gathering. There's no winning. I'm talking from experience here.

Anonymous 01/04/24 (Thu) 10:07:31 AM107654>>107649No, not everyone. Surely not me.Why would anyone want to smell someone's sweaty jacket?It's not something you wash regularly.

Anonymous 01/04/24 (Thu) 10:13:52 AM107656You think she's bad for sniffing the jacket? I like to sniff unshaven male pubic area. Just get a proper facefull and enjoy it for a few minutes. The weird part is that I prefer him NOT to have an erection while I'm doing it, since the dick is just getting in a way, and the fact that I want to sniff and rub my face doesn't necessarily mean that I want to do other sexual stuff while I'm at it.

Anonymous 01/04/24 (Thu) 11:50:44 AM107671>>63992Trying to muster up the courage to break up with my boyfriend who was my best friend for 3.5 years before we started to date. (We been dating for 1 year). When we got together, we were both in the same state of being depressed, alcoholic, aimless in life "punks". I was homeless at the time and was living with him, we slept together and 'fell in love'.Now I've almost completely cleaned myself up; I quit pot, drink only occasionally, and even quit smoking cigarettes. I applied to university and got conditionally accepted to the Artificial Intelligence program. Now I just have to study for the math and history deficiency exam and I just need at least 60% on those to confirm the acceptance.He is still aimless in life, and it makes me feel so guilty. I basically used him for housing and comfort. He wants to be a pilot but it's a lot of money to invest (60k) and he'll have to help his parents pay for it. He's struggling to make the commitment since it'll be a lot of money wasted if he realises it's not for him.  So he just sits in his room, goes to bed at 6am and wakes up at 4pm, has no friends other than me. Hands out CVs here and there, but only at bars. He went to bartending school and was a bartender for a year but it completely fucked with his already fucked sleep schedule and despite agreeing that being a bartender will ruin his physical well-being, he has only applied for bartending positions (he is currently unemployed).  When I try to offer advice he comes up with excuses as to why it won't work. And the thing is, I get where he's coming from. I know what it's like to know exactly what you need to do to feel better, but you're just too afraid of losing the familiar to make the leap. It's just so fucking annoying to be spending so much energy enabling his ruminations and anxiety. I'm sick of making it my responsibility to 'fix him'. How can I call myself a feminist when I don't even practice what I preach to other women? He's really sweet, I'm his first love, he tries his best to give me what I need from a partner, but I just think we're fundamentally incompatible and it makes me resent him. I feel like I'm dumbing myself down to be with him and it makes me hate him, but I don't know how to tell him that. In being with him I've completely isolated myself socially and really have no one but him even though I'm sociable. I also admittedly love the sex with him and I want to fuck him before breaking up, but if I do that it'll make it so much harder (and more brutal for him) to leave.
Anonymous 01/04/24 (Thu) 12:34:59 PM107683>>107671I don't envy you. You DID use him and abandoning him now absolutely means that you're a garbage human being and, if you're really his first, it will most likely traumatize him. But staying with someone you don't like anymore is definitely not an option either, even if you deserve to feel bad about it.

Anonymous 01/04/24 (Thu) 02:31:23 PM107708>>107683I didn't fall for him with the hindsight of it being a maladaptive attachment issue. I really thought it was true love, that he was the one. I I still do love him as a person and I care about his feelings; if I didn't care I wouldn't be staying with him.Do I dump him once he's in a better place or what? What do you perceive to be the morally correct choice?

Anonymous 01/04/24 (Thu) 06:52:00 PM107744>>107737What punishment? I don't think she should keep going if she doesn't want to either. It's just one of those rare situations where a woman is the one taking advantage of a moid and then magically falling out of love the moment it stops being convenient to her. Despite the fact that her only gripe with him is that he dares to go through the same difficulties she did. The feeling of shame and guilt is absolutely warranted here and conducive to her growing as a person. Assuming she'll learn from this experience and won't listen to psychopathic rads.

Anonymous 01/07/24 (Sun) 09:14:45 AM108040>>107748Before we started dating I was always there for him when he was low. When he had suicidal thoughts, I invited him to spend the night at my parents' place, every time. If he needed money, I'd give it to him.Anytime he needed to vent, I'd make myself available, no matter how late in the night. When he started a band, I came to every show. Came to their practices. I cleaned his cuts when I found out he cut himself. I helped him clean out his crack den of a bedroom.6 months ago I suggested we start going to the gym together and since then he's been loving the gym. He comes from a good home, his parents give him a credit card that he can use for food and gas, he can borrow their car. They just don't talk to each other. It just feels like he's staying the same, or improving very very slowly. He has gotten better, he isn't suicidal anymore, doesn't SH anymore, he is more able to talk about his feelings, he started going to the gym on his own. But I'm at a point in my life where I need to study 220 hours in 5 months, I want to start my own band, and, I hate to say it, my boyfriend feels like a distraction that won't yield me anything positive. I'll be leaving the country for uni, anyway. I'm sick of putting my life on the backburner for him. But on the other hand, he has done so much for me. When I was homeless he would drive half an hour to my job 3 days a week at 5am to pick me up and take me to his house. He helped me move when I finally got an apartment. He stayed with me in the hospital and visited me every day when I got a staph infection and had to be hospitalised. He offers to drive me anywhere. He drove 12 hours on his motorcycle to see me when I was living abroad, and I got him a job.No matter how good he is to me, is that a good enough reason to ignore feeling unfulfilled? Do I stick around until he's in a better place? He's been 'struggling' with very slow improvement for nearly 4 years. At this point I must be enabling him. Typing this out, this relationship doesn't even seem fair to him. I'm resentful because I feel like I'm dulling my shine to be with him. I wish love were rational, that I could just love and be with him because he loves me so much. But it isn't going that way. Does that make me an asshole?

Anonymous 01/13/24 (Sat) 11:21:45 PM108374i feel at a breaking point with my family. despite my feelings of love and moral obligation towards them, i also hate them for their dysfunction and solipsism. that feeling dominates. in a more practical sense every time i engage with them there's something wrong, so i feel like they're an obstacle. a sign that i'm weaker than other people. the people who i've been close to didn't seem as bothered by their family dysfunction. i'm unable to brush things off.i guess, also, it's easier to blame my problem on certain events and conditions of my childhood than to think that theyre genetic. in general i don't know what to expect of people, and how much unhappiness and sub-par treatment i have to accept. in any relationship i'd have to accept some, but at what point is it reasonable to draw a line?
