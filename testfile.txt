Anonymous 09/09/24 (Mon) 10:13:28 PM294004>>293927The point of the movie was that he acts like a kid and was getting shit for not acting his age, not that he's literally one kek

Anonymous 09/10/24 (Tue) 06:31:04 AM294202Spongebob has a job and a house and goes to driving school to learn how to drive, which kid does that, it's illegal, and his parents are so old they have no condition to procreate now which is clear they did a long time ago when spongebob was born. He ain't a kid but he sure should go to jail for his criminal record is enourmous. Fool never even got an actual relationship with that squirrel who is crazy about him, and he is always ruining things for her like her expedition to the moon and I am sure there was a time she was mocked to hell and back and he didn't defend her honor like a good sponge should, dunno why she didn't go back to texas yet. Now it's a wonder how spongebob retardpants managed to learn karate, squirrel girl should've karate'd his ass a long time ago. The only thing spongebob did well and I am grateful for was teaching me how to tie my shoes when everyone else had given up.

Some calcified demosponges grow by only 0.2 mm (0.0079 in) per year and, if that rate is constant, specimens 1 m (3.3 ft) wide must be about 5,000 years old. Some sponges start sexual reproduction when only a few weeks old, while others wait until they are several years old.my boy spongebob is an ancient one, maybe
