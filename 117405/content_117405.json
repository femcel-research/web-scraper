   "original post": " Subtle Pick Me Girls  Anonymous 10/03/24 (Thu) 05:11:24 AM117405maybe this post is stupid or redundant but I don't see this particular topic covered in much of the \"pick me\" discourse. I believe there is a subset of pick me girls who present in ways that don't immediately read as pick me, possibly even overtly touting feminist thought or social justice or being a \"girl's girl\" or the like that you can just subtly tell they're still looking for male validation, attention, possibly even go for taken men (might see this type of pick me in the \"female best friend\"). it's like sure they may not be tradwife Tate apologists or \"im so one of the boys im le gamer gurl teehee\" but there are subtle gestures or comments or you notice the content they like online or you see what they post and it just reeks of male gaze or male-centeredness. it's hard when you know they're aware enough of the pickme concept to not be overtly bitchy or competitive, but you just get this gut feeling they'd throw you under the bus anyway or try to steal your man to live out her \"she wears high heels I wear sneakers\" fantasy. it's the modern \"cool girl\" who doesn't know it's a death trap yet. the manic pixie who still thinks her magic is for attracting men. the indie/alt chick who only hangs around guys but never admits the real reason why. the artsy coworker who tries really hard to get your bfs attention outside of work. the \"mom friend\" who tells everyone about it, especially men she's just met. etc., etc.",

Literally anyone can be a pick me. I think it’s just more surprising to some people when someone who’s indie or alternative turns out to be a pick me because those groups tend to present as if they’re living outside the norm, rejecting the mainstream idea of seeking male approval. But at the end of the day, it doesn’t really matter if they’re obvious or subtle about it—the fact is, they are what they are.And honestly, who cares? If you don’t vibe with them, just don’t associate with them. It’s really that simple."

There are extremely cringey women who's whole existence is centered around a man, finding a man, to the point they absorb his whole personality and have none left of their own.

But it ended up to be true only to an extent and now i regret not being more flexible. I was childish. Actually people inevitably mold each other as they grow closer, its organic and as long as there is love its fine."

I'm talking about women who cozy up to someone with extreme religion, masculinity, domineering personality, or extreme toxic expectations and just become whoever that person wants.I have a friend who became this way. Even agreeing that women don't deserve life-saving abortion, or post-rape abortion. She became a complete pig for that man and i feel sorry for the daughter caught up in all that.Molding to a personality in the way you're describing is normal (but it has to be reciprocated )"
